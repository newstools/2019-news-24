The UN refugee chief says he has never seen "such toxicity, such poison" in politics, the media, social media and everyday conversation focused on refugees, migrants and foreigners. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said on Tuesday that the March 15 attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 50 worshippers was the result "of that toxic language of politics." Australian white supremacist Brenton Harrison Tarrant livestreamed the shootings and has been charged in the killings. Grandi urged countries everywhere to emulate "the people and the leadership of New Zealand" in responding to such trends by restating the values that underpin global solidarity and reaffirming "that our societies will not be really prosperous, stable and peaceful if they do not include all".
