DA leader Mmusi Maimane says the government has failed to keep South Africa's borders safe. Maimane was speaking during a visit to the Ficksburg Border Post in the Free State on Monday. There, he pointed out that no country in the world could afford to abandon its borders and allow undocumented people to come and go as they pleased. "Between the Department of Home Affairs and the South African National Defence Force, our borders right across the country have become a complete free-for-all, leaving ordinary South Africans to pay the price, and leaving communities near these borders at the mercy of criminals," said Maimane. He added that it was unacceptable that borders had become almost non-existent in places, and that border control had become severely compromised by corruption, under-resourcing and incompetence.

"Our democracy must be one of tolerance and respect for one another, and we cannot allow our relationships with foreign nationals to be characterised by mistrust, fear and violence. That is not who we are as a nation," he said. He condemned recent xenophobic attacks in KwaZulu-Natal. Maimane said the borders were essential to safeguard citizens against "rampant cross-border crime, including stock theft, vehicle theft and drug trafficking".
