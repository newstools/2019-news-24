Five children were among 53 people arrested on charges of public violence following an uprising in Maokeng, Kroonstad last week, Free State police said on Monday. Spokesperson Captain Stephen Thakeng said a large number of residents marched to the Kroonstad Magistrate's Court on Monday to support those arrested. The case was postponed to April 24 for their bail application. The adults were remanded, and the children were released into the supervision of their parents with a warning. Originally 60 people were taken into custody during a protest over service delivery and high unemployment rates.
