A 35-year-old
Johannesburg woman is desperately searching for her sister, who went missing on
14 December last year. Jannet Rowan,
who lives in Johannesburg, Gauteng, with her elderly mother, told YOU that she
last spoke to her sister, Wendy Alice Rowan, in December. Wendy (37) seemed to
be in good-spirits when they last spoke, Jannet says. “The last
time my mom and I spoke to her was on my late father’s birthday, the 13th
of December,” Jannet says. “She sounded absolutely fine, there was nothing
unusual about our call.” Jannet became
concerned when she couldn’t reach her sister for several weeks and on 9 January
of this year, she opened a missing person’s report in Amanzimtoti,
KwaZulu-Natal, where Wendy was living at the time of her disappearance. Wendy had
been planning on coming home to Johannesburg to live with her mother and sister,
according to Jannet. “She’d run
into some difficulty and was staying in a commune.” Wendy has
never been married and has no children. Eddie de
Bruin, investigating officer at Amanzimtoti police station, says he’d received
multiple leads with claims that Wendy had fled the country or that her body had
been found but all leads proved to be false. Jannet says
she’s desperate to know what has happened to her sister. “It doesn’t
make sense for someone to just disappear into thin air like that.” If anyone has
information about Wendy’s whereabouts, please contact investigating officer
Eddie de Bruin at 031-903-0520 or Jannet Rowan at 061-088-8889.
