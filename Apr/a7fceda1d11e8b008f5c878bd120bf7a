TEN suspects were arrested during a multi-disciplinary operation approached by various police units and stations around the uMzinyathi and Amajuba Cluster in connection with the hijack of a British American tobacco vehicle. The suspects, aged between 25 and 40 years of age, are facing charges of hijacking and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. The suspects were arrested a few hours after they held up a vehicle transporting tobacco near Dundee. According to Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, two victims were driving their vehicle that was transporting tobacco between Dundee and Vryheid on April 2 at around 10am. “It is alleged that while they were near Tayside, they were forced to stop by three armed suspects who were in their VW Polo. “The victims stopped and they were tied up and forced into the back of their vehicle. The suspects drove both vehicles away towards Vryheid road. “Later, both vehicles stopped in the bushes at Utrecht area and they were joined by a Quantum vehicle with more suspects. They off-loaded boxes of tobacco from the hijacked vehicle into their vehicles. The suspects fled the scene with the tobacco, leaving behind the victims,” said Zwane. Local police were alerted, and an intensive search was conducted by various units and stations in the area. Zwane explained: “Through hard work, the suspects were traced at a house at the Mdakane area outside Dundee where they were arrested. “Two unlicensed pistols and a rifle with ammunition were recovered. “Some of the boxes taken during the robber were also recovered. “A VW Polo vehicle which was used by the suspects was recovered at a house. “Our detectives will profile the arrested suspects to check if they are not involved in any other hijackings where tobacco vehicles were targeted.” The suspects are expected to appear at the Dundee Magistrate’s Court soon. — Supplied.
