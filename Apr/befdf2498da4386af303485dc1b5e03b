The case of a senior police officer accused of threatening a government official during an MK Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) conference in 2017, was postponed to give him time to sort out his legal representation. Colonel Smangaliso Simelane briefly appeared in the Boksburg Regional Court on charges of assault, crimen injuria and intimidation after he allegedly threatened the official. He was served with a summons earlier this month after the Director of Public Prosecutions decided to proceed with the prosecution. "He was asked at court if he had an attorney. He indicated he has Adv Ditseko who will represent him," Independent Police Investigative Directorate(IPID) spokesperson Moses Dlamini said. READ: Mbaks to charge top cop Dlamini said the case was postponed to April 29. Previously, News24 reported that Simelane, a former Umkhonto we Sizwe member, allegedly threatened Department of Military Veterans deputy director general Nontobeko Mafu at the Birchwood Hotel in Johannesburg two years ago. Mafu was apparently among the officials who received delegates two days before the conference got under way. Simelane allegedly approached Mafu and demanded keys for two extra rooms for his driver and protector. When Mafu told him she did not have hotel keys, Simelane allegedly "lost it and insulted Mafu in full view of other delegates".
