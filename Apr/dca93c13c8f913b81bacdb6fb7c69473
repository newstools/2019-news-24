A 21-YEAR-OLD man from KwaDambuza was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment for rape. Siyanda Ntombela was sentenced at the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court last week. It is alleged that on August 27 at 8.30 pm, a 34-year-old woman was walking with a companion and her daughter when they were approached by a known suspect emanating from the bush at KwaDambuza. At gunpoint, he instructed the companion to leave after firing shots into the air. The victim’s daughter managed to escape but the victim was dragged into a house that was in the vicinity where she was raped. The owner of the house arrived and the accused fled the scene on foot in an unknown direction. A case of rape was opened at Plessislaer SAPS and was transferred to the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit who took over the investigation. The accused was arrested and was remanded into custody until the case was finalised at court. — Supplied.
