Pemba
â€“ Rains from Cyclone Kenneth, the second tropical storm to hit Mozambique
within weeks, continued to pound the northeastern city of Pemba and surrounding
areas causing massive flooding and destruction. One death has been confirmed so
far and 160 000 people are at risk, with more torrential rain forecast in the
coming days. The government described the
situation as "critical" in other centres of Cabo Delgado province which
are unreachable by road. In a statement on Sunday night, the government said
the death toll could rise due to "worrying" rains. The towns of Ibo, Macomia and
Quissanga have been badly flooded and many buildings and homes destroyed. Most
roads are impassable from the flooding and the heavy rains have made air
contact difficult. EXPLAINER: More natural disasters hit Mozambique A second disaster has hit Mozambique in the wake of Cyclone Kenneth.  NO ARCHIVING AAP VIDEO BEYOND 48 HOUR NEWS USAGE Officials said that as soon as
the rains lift, aid distribution could begin on Monday via helicopter and boats
in Ibo and Quissanga. Canoes may be used to deliver aid in Macomia. Safe drinking water is also
becoming a challenge, as wells have been contaminated, raising the threat of
cholera. Malaria is another concern. As the rains eased in Pemba, the
provincial capital and an historic port city, some tried to return to a
semblance of daily life amid the destruction. At
a school in one suburb, school children in blue uniforms trooped into classes.
In central Pemba, traders put their wares on street pavements and wooden tables
while others were busy removing rubble from their homes and yards.
