I hope this mail find you well. I need to know how and to who do we address roads that have become very high accident roads, with deaths. This is urgent as a Midrand Primary School is in one of them in Glen Austin, Midrand. Please help urgently before any more deaths happen in this section. I am not sure who to address this matter to, but know that this must be addressed as a matter of urgency. Over the last month, I have seen three accidents on Olifantsfontein road. Two accidents occurred on the part from the corner of Hampton (two accidents) up until the corner of Allan road. I was involved in the third accident while turning into 49 Olifantsfontein road on Sunday. (The Manderston Canine Academy) Indicators were on, brake lights working, etc. I was overtaken from the right over the solid white line. My vehicle very badly damaged, and it could have been fatal â€“ the speed he was travelling, he could only stop 120 meters away near Allan road. Again this morning it was a near miss, as the driver of the other vehicle was driving so fast he drove onto the sand embankment to avoid the accident. My request is that we please apply for speed bumps or more signage to go up on that section of the road. Over the years our CPF have tried to get this matter addressed as we are dealing with deaths weekly now. Before the school children or other people are killed, please can this be addressed before more carnage on that road and loss of life? I have tried all avenues that have been given to me and still we have nothing.
