It's been 20 days since 26-year-old Germiston woman, Nosipho Ngcakane, was last seen.On March 22, Ngcakane's sister dropped her off at work. "The last time I saw was when I dropped her off at work in the morning. She was picked up by the boyfriend in the afternoon and we never saw her after that."Nobody knows anything. All we know is she was picked up from work, went to Volsoorus and we have not seen her since. She works in Germiston," the distressed sister told News24.The family has also not heard anything from Ngcakane's boyfriend, the sister said. Â Ngcakane's sister, who didn't want to be named, said that when a full weekend passed by without any word from her sister, she decided to open a missing persons case. "The police are currently investigating and we still don't know where she is and what is happening," she said. She said the family was struggling with the situation and were urging anyone who may assist in finding her to come forward. "It's a very stressful situation. She was living with me, it was just the two of us, so it's very stressful," she said. She described Ngcakane as a quiet person who would always be around the house if she was not at work."She is a sweet person. I wouldn't know if she had people she fought with because she is an adult and we lived separate lives. I do not know how her social life was" she added. The mother of two was last seen wearing a blue blouse, blue jeans and blue shoes.Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said Vosloorus police were investigating a case of kidnapping."Police cannot divulge further information at this stage because it might jeopardise the investigation," Masondo responded when News24 asked why the investigation was changed to kidnapping.
