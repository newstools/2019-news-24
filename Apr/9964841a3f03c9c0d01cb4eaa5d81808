Picture this; you’re sitting with your one-year-old daughter at home and then she suddenly swallows a coin and almost chokes to death. Naturally, like any parent would, you immediately get in the car and rush her to the hospital – but as soon as you arrive, you’re taken into custody by the police because you were speeding. This happened to American man, Darius Hinkle. BET reports that by the time Hinkle arrived at the hospital, more than a handful of police officers were behind him and he was then taken into custody and arrested for several traffic violations. When this father noticed his little girl’s life was threatened, all he thought about was making sure she’s saved. He told FOX2, “The first thing in my mind was to get her to the hospital.” So even though he does not have a valid driver’s licence, he risked it all to save his baby girl’s life. Fortunately for him, when the mother of his child went to go see him at the police station, she learned that the nurses at the hospital their child was rushed to, had already bailed Hinkle out. “Understanding the situation, several of the nurses from the Touchette Regional Hospital in Centreville pitched in to pay the bond [bail money] for Hinkle, explaining that they would have done the same thing in his situation,” she said. “I can’t thank them enough,” Hinkle told FOX2. The little girl was treated and is perfectly fine.
