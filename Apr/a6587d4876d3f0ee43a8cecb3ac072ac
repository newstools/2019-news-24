Police
are investigating a case of assault after a video showing an unknown man
mercilessly beating a KwaZulu-Natal woman while her hands were tied went viral. The video went viral after
Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi shared it on Sunday on Twitter. "A case of assault was
opened at KwaMsane police station after a woman was allegedly assaulted. The
matter is still under investigation," police spokesperson Lieutenant
Colonel Thulani Zwane said on Monday. In his tweet, Lesufi says he was
informed that the incident possibly occurred in Mtubatuba, KZN. 'We stand against any abuse' "Dear Minister [of Police] this
is brutality not discipline. Let's protect our children. I am told it happened
in Mtubatuba, KZN." Provincial
education authorities said the assault was not linked to any schools or the
education sector in the province. "There has not been any
information or report that links the KZN Department of Education with this
video clip. We however stand firm against any abuse of learners." In the video, a man is severely
beating a woman with what appears to be a stick. She writhes in pain and
screams as he unashamedly continues lashing her on her lower back. He eventually stops after she
rolls away from him.
