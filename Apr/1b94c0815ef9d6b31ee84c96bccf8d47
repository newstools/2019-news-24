A man recently employed as a bricklayer at a Bethlehem construction site was arrested at his workplace for the rape of an elderly woman and her granddaughter, Free State police said on Saturday. The suspect, who uses the alias Moholo, was believed to be behind the attack on a 78-year-old woman and the 11-year-old child. Police spokesperson Thandi Mbambo said the two had been asleep when their assailant forced his way into their home in Fouriesburg on March 17. He allegedly threatened them with a panga and cut the grandmother’s hand in a struggle. Mbambo said the intruder then took turns raping them. Police responded to a tip-off on Friday which led them to a new development in Bethlehem where the suspect was apprehended. Bethlehem Cluster Commander Major General Jan Tsotetsi commended his officers for the arrest as well as locals for “being a major part of this concerted effort”.
