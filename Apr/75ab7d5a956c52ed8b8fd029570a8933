A cheeky motorist took a bag full of coins into a police
station to pay off his speeding fine. The incident took place at a police station in Iceland’s
capital Reykjavik. Local police took pics and a video of the bag and posted it
online, where it has been viewed more than 45,000 times. In the clip, a huge blue sack is seen on the floor as a cop
rummages through it. The motorist had filled the sack with thousands of coins
to pay off his speeding ticket. The unnamed man had showed up at the station smiling,
expressing his desire to pay off his fine without further delay, according to
police. “Speeding tickets are not often paid with a smile on the
offender’s face and it can be considered a heavy experience when people come to
the station for this reason,” a police spokesperson said. “There was a lot of heaviness with this case as well, but
with an alternative meaning as the man used these coins to pay his fine! It
weighed many kilograms!” Although the amount of the man’s fine isn’t known, speeding
fines in Iceland start at 30,000 ISK (R3 400) and can go up to 150,000 ISK
(roughly R17 000). WATCH VIDEO HERE:  Source: Magazine
