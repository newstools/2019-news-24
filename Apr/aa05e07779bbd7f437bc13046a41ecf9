The Free State government says it is aware of a scammer who is allegedly claiming he works in the premier's office and is promising jobs to people on social media. The con artist is apparently using the name "Mpho Gift", and is requesting as much as R8 000 from victims in exchange for job placements. "The Office of the Premier would like to warn our people that this is but a scam," Free State government spokesperson Tiisetso Makhele said on Wednesday. Makhele said the alleged scammer was facing harsh punishment and was advised to stop soliciting money from people illegally.

Makhele added that government had formal procedures, requirements, and followed proper channels when recruiting and therefore urged people to be vigilant of scams. "The Free State provincial government would never ask for a fee or a certain amount of money in order for us to give our people jobs," he said. Makhele said the office would be approaching law enforcement authorities for further direction on the matter and warned that no government official or any other person was allowed to solicit or accept a bribe in exchange for job placements. "Should our people come across such individuals, they are advised to report them immediately to the law enforcement authorities," he said.
