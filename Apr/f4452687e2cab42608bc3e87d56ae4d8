A sting operation by the Hawks' Serious Corruption Investigation unit, in collaboration with Road Traffic Management Corporation and Special Investigating Unit, culminated in the closing down of a private vehicle testing station and the arrest of seven officials in Lephalale on Monday. According to provincial Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke, five vehicle examiners and two clerks aged between 26 and 57 allegedly used the identity particulars of unsuspecting victims to issue roadworthy certificates for vehicles that were never brought to the testing station for compulsory tests. During the operation computers and documents were seized.
