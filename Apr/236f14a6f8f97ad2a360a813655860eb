Rains from Cyclone Kenneth, the second tropical storm to hit Mozambique within weeks, continued to pound the north-eastern city of Pemba and surrounding areas causing massive flooding and destruction. One death has been confirmed so far and 160 000 people are at risk, with more torrential rain forecast for the days ahead. The government described the situation as "critical" in other centres of Cabo Delgado province which are unreachable by road. In a statement on Sunday night, the government said the death toll could rise due to "worrying" rains. READ: 'We are losing everything': Flooding in cyclone-hit Mozambique The towns of Ibo, Macomia and Quissanga have been badly flooded and many buildings and homes destroyed. Access to those centres is currently not possible by road and the heavy rains have made air contact difficult. Safe drinking water has become scarce. According to Unicef an additional 368 000 children in Mozambique are now at risk and potentially in need of lifesaving humanitarian support."Cabo Delgado has no history of cyclones and we are deeply worried that communities in the area would not have been prepared for the scale of the storm, putting children and families in a very precarious position," said Michel Le Pechoux, Unicef Deputy Representative in Mozambique.
