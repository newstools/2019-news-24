"It’s not about me, it’s about the institution. It’s the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) that has been vindicated," said former National Director of Public Prosecutions Mxolisi Nxasana on Thursday. He was reacting to the leaked Mokgoro report in which retired Constitutional Court judge Yvonne Mokgoro recommended to the president that Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions Nongcobo Jiba and Special Director of Public Prosecutions Lawrence Mrwebi be released from their duties. Mokgoro chaired an inquiry which began earlier this year into the pair's fitness to hold office, and found that they were neither fit nor proper to hold their respective positions. Mokgoro handed her report to president Cyril Ramaphosa at the beginning of April, News24 reported.

Declining to comment further, he said his "family has suffered a lot already" and that he didn’t want to put them through any more hardship.
