MASTERTONS Coffee and Tea Specialists, Nelson Mandela Bay’s original coffee roastery, is donating over R17 000 to Animal Welfare Society Port Elizabeth (AWS PE) to bolster their vital transportation fund next month. The donation is credited to the support received from coffee lovers across Nelson Mandela Bay and beyond, who have purchased hessian bags from the coffee roastery, which recently moved to their new home at 92 Main Road, Walmer. Green coffee beans are transported in these hessian bags from coffee growing countries around the world and can be reused for various purposes due to their sturdy nature. This donation will cover AWS PE’s entire transport costs for one month, keeping them mobile and able to best serve animals in need. Reliable transportation is required to carry out premises checks at adoptive homes and to facilitate the mobile clinic operating in Walmer Township. AWS PE is also required to transport stray animals collected from veterinary practices and members of the public, as well as to provide animal crematorium services to veterinary practices and the general public. “The donation is much needed and will help us in our goals immensely,” stated AWS PE manager, Hannes Stander. Mastertons’ Ryler Masterton said, “We’re always happy to assist AWS PE, and are positive that the donation will help them continue their selfless and much-needed work in our community.”
