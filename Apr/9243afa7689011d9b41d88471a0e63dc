 The Cape Town Magistrate's Court will on Tuesday hear the assault case against EFF MP Marshall Dlamini. Dlamini was caught on video slapping a plainclothes police officer after the State of the Nation Address (SONA) in February. Police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo confirmed in February that two charges of assault had been laid by a female sergeant and a male warrant officer. WATCH: EFF MP slaps security official at Parliament The Economic Freedom Fighters were caught in yet another scuffle at Parliament on Thursday, when one of their MPs assaulted a security official. WATCH: EFF MP slaps man after SONA Naidoo had said that police were investigating the matters and would send the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision on whether or not to prosecute. Following the slapping incident, the EFF claimed that the altercation was in response to a threat against the life of their leader, Julius Malema. "The EFF has received media enquiries regarding an assassination threat on the life of the CIC (commander-in-chief) Julius Malema, which had been planned to be executed during the 2019 State of the Nation Address yesterday," read a statement by EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi at the time. "The security threat implicates elite members of the police, who are in collaboration with right-wing groups to take the life of the CIC, in an attempt to undermine the advances on the expropriation of land without compensation discourse, that will soon be law."
