The investigation into the murder of a one-year-old KwaZulu-Natal boy, who was found dead last week after he was reported missing in March, led police as far as the Eastern Cape where a man was arrested. The 31-year-old man was nabbed and taken to the Phoenix police station, north of central Durban, after police followed several leads, spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said. "Police officers from Phoenix acted on intelligence with regards to the whereabouts of the suspect. Their investigation led them to Eastern Cape, where the suspect was arrested." He is due to appear in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Monday, April 8. The body of the boy was found in a grassy area at the dead end in Loftmanor Place, Trenance Manor in Phoenix on Tuesday. "It is alleged that the child went missing on Saturday, March 30 and a missing person's report was opened at Inanda SAPS (SA Police Service) as the child went missing from Amaoti," Zwane said. He said officers began searching for the suspect almost immediately.
