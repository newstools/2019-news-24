Equal Education claimed a long-awaited victory for the pupils of Vukile Tshwete Secondary School in Keiskammahoek, Eastern Cape, as construction for brand new premises started. "Construction of the new site of Vukile Tshwete Secondary School in the Eastern Cape has finally started, owing to five years of sustained pressure from [Equal Education] members," spokesperson Leanne Jansen-Thomas said on Tuesday. "We will continue to monitor the building of Vukile Tshwete Secondary to ensure that Coega and the [Eastern Cape department of education] fulfill their duties." "Equalisers [Equal Education supporters] and other members celebrate this progress, and we will continue to take to the streets for decent school infrastructure for the learners of Qobo Qobo and South Africa." The organisations said five years of pickets, marches, night vigils, and relentlessly pursuing regular meetings with the Coega Development Corporation and the department for a decent school, led to construction finally being on track. Equal Education said the current school building is mostly precarious wood structures, and the school's electricity supply is limited to the administration office. It said the sanitation facilities are ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrines for teachers, and plain pit latrines for learners. However, plain pit latrines are banned by the Norms and Standards for School Infrastructure law. Equal Education's timeline of getting to constructing a new school: "It is an indictment on the Eastern Cape government and the national government that it has taken five years for the rebuilding of this school to begin," said Equal Education. "We will continue to monitor the building of Vukile Tshwete Secondary, to ensure that Coega and the ECDOE fulfill their duties." Comment from the department was not immediately available.
