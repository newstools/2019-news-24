The government has warned residents to protect themselves as heavy rain and cold weather sweeps KwaZulu-Natal this weekend. "It is important for residents to pay attention to the weather conditions and to take all necessary steps to protect themselves from any possible harm that could be caused by the heavy rains which could lead to localised flooding," MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Nomusa Dube-Ncube said on Friday. She said Cogta had placed disaster management teams across the province on alert following a weather warning from the South African Weather Service (SAWS).

Dube-Ncube urged residents to exercise extreme caution, especially those who live in low-lying areas. "Today's warning comes at a time when the province is still in recovery from the damage caused by the recent heavy rains that battered the eThekwini region, leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake in KwaMashu and elsewhere." She said disaster management teams would keep a close watch on areas that are prone to incidents, especially during heavy rains.
