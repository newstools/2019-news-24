Police are searching for a 37-year-old murder accused who failed to appear in court, while out on R3 000 bail. Sunnyside police launched a manhunt for Obienna Greg Ofdegbuliwe after he didn't make an appearance in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court on Tuesday for his alleged role in the murder of 23-year-old Shaun Douglas Chabalala. "Chabalala and a friend had been reportedly lured to a flat adjacent to the once notorious Tamboti block in Sunnyside during May 2018 through an online advert that had indicated that a luxury camera was up for sale," police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said in a statement on Tuesday.

Chabalala's friend managed to escape, but Chabalala died after he was allegedly pushed through a window on the seventh floor. Ofdegbuliwe had earlier been arrested by Sunnyside police after they received a tip-off from a member of the public, following a five-month manhunt. "Sunnyside police undertake to leave no stone unturned in their quest to ensure that Ofdegbuliwe is recaptured," Mavimbela said.
