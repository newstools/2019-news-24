A man was killed in a shootout with police in Emanguzi in KwaZulu-Natal. According to spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police were searching for suspects who stole a vehicle during a house robbery in the area on Tuesday morning. According to police, the house robbery victim and her children were asleep at home at around 02:00 when the suspects pounced, demanding car keys and appliances. Zwane said they fled in the victim's car and made off with a grass cutter, cellphones and cash. The woman immediately reported the case to the Emanguzi police station. Then, during a multi-disciplinary operation on Wednesday morning, officers spotted a vehicle in Mfihlweni that matched the description the robbery victim had provided. "When police officers attempted to intercept the said vehicle, the occupants started to shoot towards the officers and a shootout ensued. One suspect was fatally wounded whilst the others fled the scene on foot into the bushes. The vehicle was recovered and the outstanding suspects are being sought by the police," said Zwane.
