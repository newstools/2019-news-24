The testimony of former head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) Robert McBride was postponed because the Zondo commission's legal team failed to duly notify the people he implicated. McBride was scheduled to testify on Monday, followed by former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss Major General Johan Booysen on Thursday. On Monday morning, advocate Paul Pretorius SC, head of the commission's legal team, told inquiry chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that the postponement of McBride's testimony is to allow implicated parties to be notified, as stated in the rules of the commission.

He also said serious prejudice can be avoided if McBride's testimony is postponed. "That
 is not acceptable," Zondo said. He referred to a previous incident in 
February when McBride's evidence had been postponed for the very same 
reason. He said the legal team failed for more than six weeks
 to issue notices to implicated persons, adding that those implicated 
should be treated fairly. "The commission does not have a lot of time... therefore we need to 
use every hour and every minute we have to do the work and hear 
witnesses," he said. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
