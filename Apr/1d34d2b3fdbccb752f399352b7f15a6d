Two alleged drug dealers who evaded capture in 2016 and disappeared are back on the Hawks' radar in Mpumalanga. It was recently brought to investigators' attention that the men could be in South Africa. Emanuel Ifeyalyi Onyekanna, 27, and Chukwuemeka Kingsley Ezenwa, 34, were identified as possible leaders of a drug syndicate. It is suspected that they are not only dealing drugs in South Africa, but in neighbouring countries too. In 2016, the Hawks set up a sting operation in the Secunda in the hope that they would be caught. However, the two suspects did not pitch up. It was suspected that they fled to their home country.

A warrant of arrest was issued and the court gave the Hawks permission to distribute their photographs, said Hawks spokesperson Captain Dineo Sekgotodi. Any information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects can be sent to Ras on 082 462 0760. A reward is being offered.
