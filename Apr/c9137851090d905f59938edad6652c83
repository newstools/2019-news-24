A 31-year-old man has been arrested on Friday for beheading his girlfriend at their flat in Kempton Park in Ekurhuleni. Police found the 23-year-old's body stuffed in a fridge at the pair's apartment. Spokesperson Captain Jethro Ntshali said tenants at the block of flats alerted the police on Friday morning that they suspected that the woman may have been hurt. This was because they had not seen her since Thursday night. "Some tenants allege that they heard loud arguments on Thursday night and called the police this morning (Friday) when they noticed that the woman was nowhere to be seen," said Nsthali. He said that the alleged suspect's motive for killing and beheading his girlfriend is not yet known, but police were investigating. Ntshali said that the man was arrested at a shop he rents in West street on Friday and would appear in the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court on Monday on a charge of murder.
