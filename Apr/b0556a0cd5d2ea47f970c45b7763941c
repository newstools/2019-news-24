A 55-year-old man was severely injured when he was bitten on the arm while trying to stroke a lioness at a lodge in Virginia, Free State, on Sunday, Netwerk24 reported. Pieter Nortjé and his wife, Ilze, were reportedly visiting the Tikwe River Lodge for the weekend as a gift to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. In a video that has been circulating on social media, Nortjé can be seen cuddling an adult lion by sticking his arm through a fence. "If you bite me, I'm going to bite you back!" he quips as he cuddles the lion. He is then approached by a lioness. "Come here, lovey, let daddy stroke you," he calls to her. She then locks her jaws around his right arm and pulls him towards the fence. "Eina!" Nortjé exclaims in panic. 'He's biting him!' A woman is then heard screaming, off camera: "He's biting him! He's biting him!" According to Volksblad, a shocked Nortjé, who is an artisan at SA Truck Bodies in Bloemfontein, was taken to the Katleho Hospital in Virginia and has since been transferred to the Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein. He is reportedly in a serious condition and suffering from septic shock.
