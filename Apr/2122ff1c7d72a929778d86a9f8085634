Two months after skeletal remains were found along the R67 between Grahamstown and Fort Beaufort, the identity of the corpse is still a mystery. Police have appealed to the public to help in confirming who the man was. The remains were clothed in a striped shirt, jacket and pants with tracksuit bottoms underneath. A pair of safety boots and a small bunch of keys were also found at the scene. SAPS in a statement said the skull would be sent for possible DNA analysis. Anyone able to shed light on the identity of the person is urged to phone Lieutenant Colonel Riaan Havenga on 0824168279 or Detective Warrant Officer Danny Brits on 0824110832. Meanwhile, Algoa Park police is tying to trace the next of kin of an unidentified man who was in December found lying in Struan Way in Struandale. The man, who appeared to be between 30 and 40 years old - had sustained a gunshot wound to his head as well as bruises to his body. Authorities believed his body - clothed in a white tracksuit top with blue stripes on the sleeves, pants and shoes - had been dumped there.
