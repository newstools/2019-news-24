These grannies, who have gone viral on social media, are
proving that you can never be too old to break it down – even if it’s at church. Their video was posted by Twitter user Tumi Sole onto the platform and shows the
trio, dressed in what appears to be a church uniform, dancing and singing. The grannies, who are dressed in black and white, sing a
church song before casually doing the vosho. The video has reached 212 000 views on Twitter alone and
has received positive comments from users, who commend the older women for
using a unique way to worship in church. Although it is not clear where the video originated from or
who the women are – their video has brought joy to a lot of people. Watch the video below:
