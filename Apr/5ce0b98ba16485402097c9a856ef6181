It is D-day for teaching and learning to resume at an Ennerdale school, failure to do so, it will officially be closed. Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi issued the stern warning last Tuesday following concerns that academic activities in Oakdale Secondary School were being disrupted due to violent protests and subsequently affecting pupils and planned academic programmes. "This is to inform the community that they have until Tuesday, 23 April 2019, to allow teaching and learning to resume, failing which MEC Panyaza Lesufi will have no any other option but to assist them to officially close the school accordingly," the department said in a statement on Tuesday. The School Governing Body (SGB) closed the school over concerns of poor infrastructure. They were demanding urgent repairs. A classroom was set alight and police had to fire rubber bullets and stun grenades as tensions were high during protests last week. The community was frustrated on delays in the renovations at the school. Lesufi said the disruptions had a negative impact on learning, adding that the department had approved a budget to maintain the school.
