The league match between Red Lion FC and Storm Breakers FC ended up in a 2-2 draw at Vuyiseka Sport Complex in Philippi on Sunday. Lions from Lower Crossroads went to half time leading with a goal. Breakers from Marcus Garvey equalised in the second half and the game ended in a draw. Lion coach Asanda Dantile praised his boys for showing good football. “It was a tough game. And my boys gave it all on the field. We were looking for maximum points but we accept a point,” said Dantile. He said he believed if he had a good goal scorer they could have wrapped up the game in the first half. “I had to convert a left back player to a striking position because our main striker wasn’t there. But we managed to score two goals,” he said, adding that he believes in attacking football. However, he emphasised that he has a problem with his centre defenders which he needs to improve his game. Storm Breakers coach Joe Nombanga said it was a good game for both sides. “A point is better than nothing because at the end of the season we will need it. I’m proud of my boys even though they make some mistakes at the back,” he said. Nombanga said their plan is to take one game at a time till they finish the league. Storm Breakers is on position three on the league with five games and 13 points. Red Lion is currently in ninth place with eight points.
