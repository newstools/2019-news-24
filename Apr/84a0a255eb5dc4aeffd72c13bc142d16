South Africa joined the solidarity expressed to France on Tuesday following the catastrophic fire at the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. "We join the people of France in grieving this tragic loss of the 12th century heritage building and one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country," said International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu. "We also wish them great success in the rebuilding of this iconic part of France’s culture and history." Parts of the cathedral were destroyed in a massive blaze that started early on Monday evening. Hundreds of firefighters eventually put the fire out.
