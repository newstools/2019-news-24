The Minister of Higher Education and Training, Naledi Pandor, announced that the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) has allocated an additional sum of R967m to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) to settle the historic debt owed to universities by 52 514 NSFAS funded continuing students. Pandor said the issue of the historic debt owed to universities by these students has been of a concern and had been raised by all stakeholders for some time. “This is a significant contribution which will alleviate some of the debt owed to universities by students and is confirmation that government is sensitive to the plight of students from poor and working-classfamilies,” she said. The allocation is specifically for those who had been funded on the previous funding scheme of NSFAS prior to the significantly improved funding support that began in 2018. Historically, these students were required to fund part of their costs through family or own funding and were not able to do so, hence the debt. Pandor indicated that this is the first phase of the assessment of the historical debt owed to universities. Work on the due diligence exercise begun by Pandor, in consultation with the minister of Finance Tito Mboweni and minister of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma continues.Reaching a milestone “We have now concluded, the first phase of the due diligence and found that 52 514 NSFAS qualifying students who were registered for the 2018 academic year owed universities R 967m,” Pandor said. “Historic debt refers to money owed to the university by continuing NSFAS qualifying senior student who was registered in the 2018 academic year, was funded by NSFAS on a family income threshold of an R122 000 per annum, and met the academic criteria to enable them to graduate within minimum time plus two years.” The funding provided by NSFAS for these students was subject to a funding cap and often included an expected family contribution. As a result, the amount of funding provided by NSFAS was sometimes insufficient to cover the total actual fees and cost of study, particularly at universities and programmes with high fees. This resulted in students accruing debt with their institution despite being funded by NSFAS. Pandor said they are aware that there will be some students who entered the university system prior to the new scheme being implemented in 2018, who will continue to be funded through NSFAS on the previous 2018 funding model. These students would have accrued further debt during their 2018 academic year if their fees were above the NSFAS cap. In order to address this, Pandor said, her department plans to provide funding to NSFAS during this academic year to clear this debt. It is expected that all the students funded through the old scheme on an R122 000 threshold, would have exited the system by the 2022 academic year. Pandor also appealed to stakeholders in the society, particularly the private sector, to work with the government and institutions in finding a solution for support to students from families that cannot afford to pay university study costs and stressed that the department will work with all stakeholders to find ways to relieve the debt burden of these students to assist the government in developing a comprehensive student funding solution to assist ‘missing middle’ students to fund their university studies.
