A fire has raged through the top floors of a 21-story residential building in the Philippine capital in the middle of a scorching summer and officials say firefighters managed to guide residents to safety. Mayor Edwin Olivarez told The Associated Press by telephone that more than 100 firetrucks converged on Monday to battle the blaze that hit the Pacific Coast Plaza condominium in Paranaque city, where one lane of a coastal road along Manila Bay was closed due to falling debris. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or deaths. Olivarez says firefighters managed to put the fire under control about three hours later. He said inspectors would inspect the gutted floors to assess the damage.
