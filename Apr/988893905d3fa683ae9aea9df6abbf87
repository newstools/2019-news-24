The 28 political parties in the Free State that have registered to contest the 2019 provincial and national elections, have signed the Code of Conduct. The 28 parties signed to adhere to the Elec­toral Code of Conduct at a ceremony in Bloemfontein on Friday (12/04). The Code of Conduct aims to promote “conditions that are conducive to free and fair elections” and that create a climate of tolerance, free political campaigning and open public debate. According to the Electoral Commission (IEC) in the province, it is the first time that over 20 parties have registered in the Free State to contest elections. The Free State reportedly now has the largest number of registered parties who will contest on 8 May during the sixth election since the dawn of democracy in South Africa in 1994. The Code of Conduct also discourages among other the use of language that provokes and the destroying, removing or defacing of posters of other parties. Itumeleng Liba, manager of electoral operations of the IEC, said 11 new parties were formed ahead of this year’s elections. The 28 parties will contest to get the votes of the 1,4 million voters registered for the election.
