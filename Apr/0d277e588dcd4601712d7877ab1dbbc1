Entertainer Somizi Mhlongo and Gqom artist Babes Wodumo did not pass up the opportunity to wish former president Jacob Zuma a happy birthday when they shared the same flight on Friday. In a video on Instagram posted by Somizi and Zuma's wife, Thobeka Madiba-Zuma, Somizi is seen holding the phone recording and singing "happy birthday to you". Simelane, passing by a seated Somizi, appears and whispers "can I also feature in the video" before walking away. Somizi then continues singing before revealing that he is seated next to the Zumas. Zuma beams as Mhlongo wishes him a "happy 21st". Thank you @somizi and @babes_wodumo for wishing hubby the happiest birthday. Time to call it a day or get the show started???? #happy #birthday #msholozi #wifelife?? ?????????????? A post shared by  Tobeka Madiba Zuma Foundation (@tobeka_madiba_zuma) on Apr 12, 2019 at 2:18pm PDT  Zuma celebrated his 77th birthday on Friday and received well wishes from many social media users as well as members of the ruling ANC. Secretary-General of the ANC, Ace Magashule lead the birthday wishes on Twitter, saying: "I'd like to wish President @PresJGZuma a happy birthday. Ukhule Nxamalala #ZumaDay."  Zuma then responded to the tweet by urging Magashule to remain "resolute" as he faces the aftermath of the release of Gangster State: unravelling Magashuleâ€™s web of capture, by investigative journalist and author Pieter-Louis Myburgh. The book contains allegations that Magashule led the Free State with an iron fist and details his involvement in the state capture project. Zuma tweet response read: "Thank you my SG and stay resolute during these times."  The former president shares a birthday with Public Enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan who turned 70.
