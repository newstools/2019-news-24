President Cyril Ramaphosa launched the ANC political school, named after struggle stalwart Oliver Reginald Tambo, on Thursday. The school was launched at Gallagher Estate in Midrand, Johannesburg to honour Tambo's contribution to the struggle to liberate South Africa. "This is a significant step towards the renewal of the ANC. It is consistent with the historical role of the ANC in building its members and leaders to be agents of change. It is only through ethically and intellectually grounded members that the ANC can continue to lead society," chairperson of the school, Kgalema Motlanthe, said. Board members of the school include Motlanthe, principal David Masondo, Alison Bengtson, Aubrey Mokadi, Cassel Mathale, Derrick Swartz, Douglas Ramaphosa, Jabulani Sithole, John Pamapallis and Joshua Maluleka. ANC secretary general Ace Magashule said the board comprised people who had a strong background in design, curriculum development and the delivery of political education. Masondo outlined course content, saying the institution would facilitate education on strategic studies, policy and organisational skills. "Thirteen courses offered will be delivered on different platforms which includes use of information communication technology as well as face-to-face interactions between students and facilitators," said Masondo. The 13 courses to be offered at the OR Tambo School of Leadership include political economy, developmental state, ANC vision, values and principles, Africa in the global economy, as well as gender and women emancipation. "The course content and methods of delivery are designed in such a way that they will be accredited in the medium term," Masondo added.
