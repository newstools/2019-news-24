Western Cape police are on the hunt for two suspects following the fatal shooting of a man outside the Tygerberg hospital in Cape Town on Monday morning. According to police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andr√® Traut, the incident took place at around 11:15. Traut confirmed that the man is from Elsies River and was shot in the parking area outside the hospital. "The circumstances are under investigation and the suspects are yet to be arrested," said Traut. According to previous reports, the deceased is linked to a gang that has been operating in the Elsies River community. He is believed to be the same man who was shot by unidentified suspects earlier this month. Earlier this year, a video of an apparent shootout in Elsies River emerged. The video was widely shared on Facebook. In the video, two men are seen hiding behind a green container outside a block of flats. As they hide, gunshots coming from the other side of the container can be heard. Back and forth gunshots ring out throughout the video.
