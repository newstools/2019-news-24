More than 30 000 firearms were destroyed on Wednesday by the South African Police Service in its battle to eradicate illegal firearms and ammunition in South Africa. The stockpile, which has grown to 30 039 firearms since the last national firearm destruction in 2016, was destroyed at the Arcelor Mittal's plant in Vereeniging. Police Minister Bheki Cele and national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole were in attendance. According to a statement by police, the firearms that were destroyed were either seized, surrendered or forfeited to the state. "In order to prevent the commission of serious and violent crimes, and to stamp the authority of the state, police have to continue to actively detect and remove these illegal firearms from circulation," the statement read. "The SAPS will continue and remains committed to fight the proliferation of illegal firearms and ammunition, as they pose a threat to the safety and security of the inhabitants of this country."
