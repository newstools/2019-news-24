Sentencing proceedings of the convicted murderers of 80-year-old Paradyskloof guest house owner Marie Verwey are expected to continue in the Western Cape High Court on Tuesday. This after proceedings were postponed last week for an eleventh-hour assessment to establish whether her carer, who was one of four people convicted of the murder, had a personality disorder. Verwey was stabbed 62 times on February 16, 2017. The carer, Nicole Geldenhuys, and three others - Geldenhuys' lover Romeo Hendricks, Enrico Malherbe and Andre Coetzee - were found guilty of murdering and robbing Verwey. READ: Sentencing of guest house owner's murderers delayed for last-minute mental state report Background reports on the four accused revealed that Nicole Geldenhuys was severely abused inside and outside the home, News24 previously reported. Geldenhuys' mother, a domestic worker, primarily looked after her because her father was always at sea. Probation officer Katrina Moses testified during pre-sentencing proceedings on March 26 that Geldenhuys had a violent and abusive upbringing. While in prison, she had also been involved in fights, seemingly unable to stop herself during a dispute. This resulted in the necessity for the assessment. Moses told the court that Geldenhuys might have a personality disorder, but that she did not have the qualifications to confirm that.
