A man who killed a relative by accident and then dumped his body, shot himself after making a confession. The double tragedy rocked the village of Ematimatolo in KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday, police said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said that 26-year-old Sinenkosi Zondi was accidentally shot by a relative while under the influence. The relative tried to take him to hospital for treatment, but he died on the way. He then drove to a cliff with Zondi's body and threw it over the cliff into bush and trees.
