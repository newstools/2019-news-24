As communities in KwaZulu-Natal take stock in the aftermath of ravaging floods in the province, the spotlight has also been turned on the waste that has washed up along Durban’s beaches. People who witnessed the debris took photos and shared them on social media with many captions reading along the lines of "this is what will happen if we do not protect our environment". At Durban’s harbour and beaches alike, tons of plastic are being washed into the sea. Facebook user Ash Erasmus posted pictures on her profile on Tuesday, captioned: "If ever you needed a reminder of just how badly we've treated the environment." Many people commented on the post with sentiments of "shock", "sadness" and "disgust" at the state of the environment.

She commented: "Today [Wednesday], most of the plastic is gone … of the 4 000 [people who shared her post] someone with an ability to collect all of that junk must have seen the post. Someone who could have turned awareness into action." At least 51 people have been confirmed dead following heavy rains and flooding in the province. Others have been left injured and displaced. President Cyril Ramaphosa visited affected areas that were ravaged by floods in the KwaZulu-Natal area on Wednesday, conveying condolences to those who lost loved ones while announcing that relief funds would be allocated.
