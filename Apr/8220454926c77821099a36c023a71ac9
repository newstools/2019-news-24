A social workers' report, which is expected to be presented in the case of two teens accused of killing a pupil at a special school in Seshego, Limpopo, is still in the process of being compiled. According to National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) provincial spokesperson Mashudu Malabi, the teens were likely to appear in the Seshego Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. They were expected to make their first appearance in court on Monday. However, social workers were still busy compiling the report on Monday and the appearance is likely to take place on Tuesday, Malabi said. "Normally, the social workers first have to compile a report for the court. They (the teenagers) are likely to appear tomorrow (Tuesday)," Malabi said. The two teens, aged 14 and 16, were arrested over the weekend after a 12-year-old pupil was found dead in the dormitory of Grace and Hope Special School in Seshego. In a statement, provincial education spokesperson Sam Makondo said that two pupils who shared a room with the deceased told staff members on duty that the boy was no longer moving or breathing. "On their investigation, the teachers immediately called paramedics and the police, who confirmed the bad news as they couldn't resuscitate the learner. This special school caters for learners with severe intellectual disabilities." Senior officials of the department visited the school and the pupil's parents were called and informed of the incident, Makondo said. Details surrounding the death were still sketchy on Monday. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the ongoing investigation will reveal more details.
