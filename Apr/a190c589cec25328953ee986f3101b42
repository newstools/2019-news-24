A man was killed and two others injured after being hit on a highway in Cape Town, apparently after their vehicle broke down, Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said on Sunday. The men's Opel came to a stop on the R300, just before the N2 in Mitchells Plain, around 20:00 on Saturday. "The three occupants of the Opel got out of the vehicle and were struck by a Nissan light motor vehicle," Africa said. Seventeen people have died on the province's roads over Easter weekend.
