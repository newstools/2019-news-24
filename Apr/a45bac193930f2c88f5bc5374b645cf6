Fact-checking organisation Africa Check has found that President Cyril Ramaphosa's claim on housing in South Africa is indeed false. In the wake of service delivery protests in the township of Alexandra just outside of Sandton, Johannesburg, Ramaphosa paid the disgruntled community a visit and made the claim that government had built 4 million houses in South Africa and would build a million more.

This would be implemented through the Department of Human Settlements. Researchers at Africa Check, Naphtali Khumalo and Kate Wilkinson, however found that "the government has built 3.3 million 'housing units' since democracy in 1994". The fact=checking organisation also found incorrect reporting in the media which gave the impression that the President stated that a million homes would be built in the township of Alexandra. "The media reported that Ramaphosa had said the million houses would be built in Alexandra. He actually said they would be built across the country," the organisation concluded.
