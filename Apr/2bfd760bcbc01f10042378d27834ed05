Fitness influencer Sbahle Mpisane is a free woman after the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) withdrew her reckless and negligent driving charges stemming from a horrific accident in 2018. According to KZN spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, the NPA decided to not prosecute Sbahle. "The docket was sent to the Senior Public Prosecutor for a decision. He later withdrew the charges," revealed Zwane. KZN SAPS decided to charge the fitness trainer for reckless and/or negligent driving after she allegedly lost control of her car on Victoria Embankment in Durban in August last year. Eight months later, the fitness bunnie is off the hook and she is very excited. "I am very happy that the charges have been withdrawn", she told Isolezwe. "[T]hinking about it, [it] caused me a lot of stress." She also revealed that after the accident she thought people didn’t love her anymore and that they wouldn’t look at her the same way they did before the accident. This forced her to avoid logging on social media platforms until months later. "I only started logging on in December. I was touched when I saw messages of love and support, I realised that people love me and they are with me through this difficult time. I would like to thank everyone." KZN NPA head Advocate Moipone Noko told DRUM that the charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence. "The docket came to the NPA as a decision docket. Upon perusal, a decision was taken to not prosecute due to insufficient evidence," she said. DRUM’s attempts to reach Sbahle were unsuccessful at the time of publishing.
