President Cyril Ramaphosa has undertaken to go to communities in flood-stricken KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and the Eastern Cape when he returns form his work visit to the Arab Republic of Egypt. At least 32 people have been confirmed dead on Tuesday in KZN, with homes swallowed by raging floods, while scores of others have been misplaced in Port St Johns in the Eastern Cape, forcing them to take refuge in community halls and churches. Ramaphosa has expressed his personal sadness at the loss of life and damage to property experienced. "As South Africans, the entire nation’s thoughts and prayers are with the people of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape who have been affected by the forces of nature against which they had little defence," said the president.
