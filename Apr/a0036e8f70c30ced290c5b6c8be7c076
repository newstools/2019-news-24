transporting them to school was involved in a collision in New Germany, Durban. According to Rescue Care Spokesperson Garrith Jamieson the accident
involved the taxi which was carrying the school children and a smaller Chevrolet
bakkie. “There were no fatal injuries fortunately, but all the children
were transported to the hospital with injuries as a result of the accident.” “I am not sure if the taxi was overloaded or not, but I can
confirm that a total of 18 children and three adults were injured as a result
of the accident.”  What to know about
