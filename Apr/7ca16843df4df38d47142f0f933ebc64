Former senior EFF member Thembinkosi Rawula, who was snubbed from the party's national list, has found a new home in Numsa's Socialist Revolutionary Workers Party (SRWP). SRWP president Irvin Jim confirmed to News24 that Rawula had approached his party on the ground in the Eastern Cape. Jim said Rawula's membership was being processed. "He voluntarily approached our structures. Our understanding is that he has not made any demands to go to Parliament," Jim said. The EFF, similarly to the SRWP, has pro-poor ideals. In 2014, EFF leader Julius Malema made attempts to lure Numsa to form an alliance. In the context of the working class and unions, Numsa is seen to wield enormous influence, having the largest number of members in the country. Rawula resigned from the EFF amid a bitter war of words over the party's financial resources. Malema has vowed to sue Rawula for R1m in defamation.

In a 35-point letter, Rawula indicated his intention to resign from the party. "Let the history judge me, both in terms subjective and objective realities. If I have betrayed the revolution, I will take any punishment that comes by my way. "I subscribe to the notion that, 'society does not perish because of bad people, but society perishes because good people have decided to keep quiet until death'. "Let the society judge me for taking this long to speak, but in mitigation of my sentence, I HAVE FINALLY SPOKEN. "I will now listen to your press conference with peace as the none member of the EFF (sic)." KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
