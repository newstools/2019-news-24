A man, who allegedly swindled R1.3m from the Eskom coffers, is being sought by the Hawks in Mpumalanga. An internal audit by Eskom established that Micheal Chimazi, 56, who was awarded an Eskom tender in 2013 and 2014 submitted numerous false invoices to the electricity giant. These invoices were then paid. However, it was later established that the work for which he claimed, was not done. Chimazi managed to fool the power giant with the assistance of Cinderela Moropane, who was an Eskom employee and his girlfriend at the time.
