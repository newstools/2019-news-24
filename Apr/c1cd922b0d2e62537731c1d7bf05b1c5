Shocking footage of a woman kicking her 3-year-old model daughter's bottom because she was "too tired to perform" has been doing the rounds on social media. The girl, known only as Niu Niu, a well-known child model, is said to have been doing a photoshoot when the incident occurred, reports Metro. The video was recorded on Monday in Hangzhou city, in China's eastern Zhejiang province, and started going viral on Wednesday. The mother has been forced to apologise following accusations that she was "abusing" her daughter and using her "as a tool to make money". According to news outlet Asia One, she issued her apology on Twitter-like platform Sina Weibo and defended herself in media interviews. In the post, she claims she had absolutely no intention of hurting or abusing her daughter. She also told Beijing News: "My husband has a job, our family doesn't rely on Niu Niu to make a living." "It was getting dark at that time and Niu Niu was about to run out to the street, so my actions were out of worry for her," she said. However, according to Daily Mail, people weren’t convinced, with one pointing out "there is no street in front of Niu Niu but just a wall". Niu Niu has worked as a fashion model for about six months and is said to be very popular among online stores needing children to pose in their clothes. One shop owner, who’s worked with Niu Niu, told Beijing News the girl was being overworked. He explained that her mother had sought "many orders" from various clients at the same time to make money. Two more clips have since emerged online of more alleged abuse. One shot in March shows Niu Niu's mother beating her with a hanger and shouting. It’s not clear whether Chinese police are investigating the incident. Sources: Asia One, Daily Mail, Metro
