Sentencing proceedings have been delayed in the trial into the murder of Baby Daniel, a toddler who was abused and killed in 2016. The proceedings of Baby Daniel's mother,Â Maryke Cloete*, and her former boyfriend, Timothy Naidoo, were supposed to go ahead in the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Monday. However, they had to be postponed to Tuesday because a pre-sentencing report was outstanding and one of the accused's lawyers was ill and could not attend. Naidoo was convicted of the child's murder after he tortured, abused and killed three-year-old Daniel at the couple's home in Naturena in June 2016. Cloete was found guilty of child abuse and negligence. Daniel had a broken elbow, broken femur, injured ribs and second-degree burns to 60% of his body, News24 previously reported. But Naidoo, who is not the child's biological father, claimed the child had fallen into a bath of hot water and was found dead the next day.
