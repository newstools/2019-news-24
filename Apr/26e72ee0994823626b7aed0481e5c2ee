Four bodies have been found in the vicinity of the Hout Bay Sports Field on Monday morning. Netwerk24 reported that four people have been shot dead, and provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut confirmed that two taxi passengers have been injured. Ward councillor Roberto Miguel Quintas earlier confirmed to News24 that three bodies had been found. Police and the City of Cape Town's metro police are on the scene in the area. While the circumstances of the deaths are still unclear, Quintas says it's believed they could be linked to an ongoing taxi industry battle. Last week, one man - believed to be a taxi driver - was shot dead in the area.

Quintas says while traffic through the area is slow, no roads have been blockaded this morning. However, motorists have been urged advised to make use of alternative routes. "The situation, although currently calm, is potentially volatile and as such residents are advised to please use alternative routes such as Victoria or Chapman’s Peak," Quintas said. He says Western Cape authorities suspended the operating licences of two taxi associations who are fighting over control of routes through Hout Bay.
