WATCH: Two trains on fire at Cape Town station, CBD engulfed in smoke WATCH | True blue: Ramaphosa launches new trains in Cape Town President Cyril Ramaphosa unveiled two new trains at Cape Town Station as part of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa's (PRASA) efforts to improve commuter services. He explained that three fire engines, a water tanker and a rescue vehicle were sent to the station just before 16:00 to contain the fire. There were no injuries reported and the cause of the fire is not known yet. Carelse said an investigation into possible arson will be left up to the SA Police Services and the Passenger Rail Services of SA. The ANC in the Western Cape described the incident as "sabotage" and urged the police to swiftly arrest those responsible. "These trains belong to the nation of South Africa. Setting them on fire is a crime against the people. There is nothing to justify such a crime," said ANC Western Cape secretary Faiez Jacobs in a statement.  "The perpetrators should be charged, brought to court, convicted and given the maximum prison sentences that can be imposed for these crimes. A clear message must be sent out that our nation will not allow sabotage to go unpunished." Huge palls of black smoke spread throughout the city centre, carried by strong winds with the  smell of burnt plastic and rubber permeating in the air.
