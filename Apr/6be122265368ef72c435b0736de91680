A pastor is trying to pick up the pieces after his church was looted and vandalised during protest action in Pretoria West on Thursday. During the protests at Gomorrah informal settlement, a small group of people stoned the church, the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk Wesmoot, breaking the stained windows. They also attempted to petrol bomb the church and later broke in and ransacked it. They stole a laptop, speakers and fans.

A pained and emotional pastor, Rudi Botha, told News24 that repairing the damage would likely cost thousands. He did not want to comment on how he felt about what happened, saying: "I don't think you want to hear what I will say about that." When asked if the church and community would be safe, Botha questioned whether anyone was safe in South Africa.
