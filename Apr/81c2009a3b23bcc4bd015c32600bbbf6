Caregiver abusing children at a crèche in Carletonville, Gauteng. (Supplied) News24 was unable to get comment from the creche where the abuse allegedly happened, however, the principal told EWN that the videos that went viral were captured a year ago. The principal was made aware of the videos last week after a person who filmed the events allegedly attempted to blackmail the school. The school explained to EWN that after learning of the abuse, the employee who is seen in the videos was reported to Child Protection Services, who then arrested her. A relative of one of the children involved only learned of the abuse on Thursday. "The child in the video is actually my niece, the video was taken 2 years ago and we only found out today", she wrote on Twitter. EWN further reported that parents have been fetching their kids from the nursery after the video went viral.
