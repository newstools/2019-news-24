This loveable pup is a real-life Pawcasso, having made thousands of rands from painting a series of abstract masterpieces. Hunter, a cute Shiba Inu, was taught by his owners, Kenny Au and Denise Lo, to paint. He now creates amazing masterpieces at his home in Alberta, Canada. Five-year-old Hunter’s artworks would look right at home in a modern-art gallery and, to date, the pooch has sold more than 150 paintings. These are sold through Hunter’s Etsy store and have made the artistic pooch more than £3 800 (about R70 000) in the process. “One thing that we’re always impressed with is how unique each painting is,” Kenny said. “He can get pretty creative with his brushstrokes, depending on his mood. “We see lots of dabs and check marks with the heavier brushes and then some loops and flicks with the lighter brushes.” The couple started painting with Hunter in March 2017. But, initially, this was simply a “mental-enrichment” exercise for the dog. Rescue organisations In need of artworks to put in their home, Kenny and Denise decided to teach Hunter how to create paintings. Amazed at how well the initial paintings turned out, the couple decided to continue working with their beloved dog to create more works. They took him to agility classes and even taught him to clean up after himself. According to Kenny and Denise, it takes between 10 and 15 minutes for Hunter to create a piece and the final works sells for around £43 (about R800) each. The couple are planning to work with rescue organisations by donating several of Hunter’s works for sale. “We’ve seen a lot of support for Hunter from everyone over the past couple of years. We love seeing the memes and reading the fan mail Hunter gets. “We feel that Hunter’s work relates to a lot of people, especially now with everything being online. Many people who enjoy Hunter’s work are animal lovers or – some more specifically – Shiba lovers.” SEE PICS HERE:
