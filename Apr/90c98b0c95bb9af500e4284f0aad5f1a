Police in Welkom, Free State are still searching for a driver of a Ford Ranger who killed a dad and three children on Friday night. On Monday morning, News24 reported that the father and his children, as well as the child of a family friend, were killed in a hit-and-run incident shortly after they were involved in a separate accident that left a woman dead. Theuns Lubbe, 39, his two children, Tristen, 8, and Amory, 4, and the family friend's child Juliana Gomez, 6, were struck down by a Ford Ranger bakkie close to the wreck of Lubbe's Chery QQ3 that had rolled moments before, fatally injuring his wife and mother of the Lubbe children, Elmarie, 38.
