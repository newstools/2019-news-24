An argument inside an Elliotdale salon resulted in the murder when a 23-year-old man was knifed to death, Eastern Cape police said on Saturday. A 30-year-old suspect has since been traced and arrested, spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha has confirmed. The two had been at the salon on Friday night when a quarrel broke out, the nature of which police are yet to determine. “The [younger] man was stabbed in his upper body. He was rushed to a local hospital where he passed away,” Manatha said. The alleged knifeman is in police custody and is expected in the Elliotdale Magistrate’s Court on Monday on a murder charge.
