Good day to the Editor, Pieter du Toit's article "Why Steve Hofmeyr is increasingly being isolated" refers. Du Toit speaks for many of us who, like me, come from Afrikaans homes and are Afrikaans. That means I fully support corporates that are isolating Hofmyer, and hopefully this includes Naspers and its many publications. With respect, to suggest that Black people are the "architects of Apartheid" is simply the biggest insult imaginable to a race group, let alone the string of other highly offensive and divisive incidents Hofmeyr has indulged in publicly over the years. It was therefore most refreshing to read in Die Burger recently that Pieter Dirk Uys is performing again at the KKNK festival; reading between the lines, his return to KKNK may have had something to do with Hofmeyr's departure although this has not been stated publicly. When politicians devise divisive and racially-based policies and public utterances the last thing SA needs is for artists to follow suit; as violence begets violence, racism does the same. Sincerely, Louise Cook Fish Hoek
