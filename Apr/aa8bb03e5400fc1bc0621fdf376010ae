Euthanasia advocate Sean Davison is expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Monday, facing two premeditated murder charges. Davison, who is the founder of right-to-die organisation DignitySA, was arrested in 2013 for the death of his friend, Anrich Burger, who had become a quadriplegic after a car crash. News24 reported that according to the charge sheet, he "administered a lethal amount of drugs to the quadriplegic deceased" at or near the Radisson Hotel in Granger Bay on November 2, 2013.
