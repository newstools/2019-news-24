A 36-year-old man, accused of sexually molesting his 14-year-old stepdaughter and exposing her to pornography, will remain behind bars until his bail application is heard on April 15. The man, who cannot be named in terms of the law, appeared in the Nelspruit Magistrate's Court on Friday, where his case was postponed for a formal bail application. According to a police statement, the victim's mother recently noticed her daughter behaving strangely and saw self-inflicted cuts. "She then investigated and discovered that she has been allegedly sexually molested by the stepfather, dating back to 2017," said police spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe.
