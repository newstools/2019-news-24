Police have launched a manhunt for a sex offender after he escaped from the Nigel Correctional Centre in Gauteng on Wednesday. Department of Correctional Services (DCS) spokesperson Zandile Mabunda could not tell News24 how Johannes Petrus Cordier managed to escape detention, but said that an investigation was under way. "The circumstances relating to the escape will be known once the investigation has been concluded," Mabunda said. According to the department, Cordier was sentenced in June 2018 to three years in prison for sexual assault. "The department is appealing to the public to assist with any information that may lead to his rearrest," Mabunda said.
