A four-year-old
girl in the United States has been praised for keeping her two-month-old
brother alive after the murder-suicide of their parents, CBS
Los Angeles reports. The
two children were left to fend for themselves for more than three days after their
father shot and killed their mother before taking his own life at their home in
Chatsworth, Los Angeles. The
murder-suicide is said to have happened on 11 April but it wasn’t until 14
April that neighbours Olivia and James Robinson – who live
across the street from the deceased couple – found the two young children
unharmed but dehydrated at the family’s home. “She
obviously was in bad condition because she reeked really bad of urine and she
had more of a blank stare on her face,” Olivia said
of the daughter. “She was very, very quiet.” After
a search of the home the parents’ bodies were found in an upstairs bedroom. A
medical examiner identified the father as 46-year-old David Kooros Parsa and
mother as 38-year-old Mihoko Koike Parsa. David is said to have suffered from
mental health issues such as depression and stress. The
children have now
been placed in the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services. “Our
little angel was able to keep herself and her brother alive,” said Los Angeles
police captain Maureen Ryan, who added that the girl remembered hearing a loud
noise and her mother crying. “The
baby is a miracle baby and the little girl is a hero. She’s an absolute hero.” So
far $2 000 (R29 000) has been raised for the children, along with donations of
baby supplies. Meanwhile
police are trying to get in touch with the mother’s family, who live in Japan.  Sources:
