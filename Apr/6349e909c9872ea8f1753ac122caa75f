“YOUR identity document is unblocked. Sorry for the inconvenience.” This is what Simon Phiri (66) was told at Home Affairs’ Pietermaritbzurg office in Church Street after they blocked his identity document for five years saying that he is not from South Africa but Malawi. Phiri’s ID was blocked in 2015 and was only unblocked on January15 this year. Echo reported on the story about Phiri’s ID twice in 2018. Speaking to Echo, Phiri said he is happy that his ID was finally unblocked, however, he is still not happy with the fact that Home Affairs did not give him with any reason as to why they had blocked his ID for such a long time. “I spend a lot of money paying lawyers to help me but they did not help I had to follow up on this matter myself. After being on their case for almost two years the only thing they told me was ‘sorry for the inconvenience’. “They messed up my life for five years and that is the only explanation? Is that all they have to say to me? “They have treated me baldly and I deserve a better explanation. They put me through hell and my life came to halt for five years. “Every night I feared that if I die my family will be left with problems because my ID was blocked for no reason,” he said. Phiri said he was supposed to register for a government grant four years ago but he could not because he did not have an identity document. He said he could have done a lot of things during those five years that he had to wait. “They have wasted five years of my life. Now I feel like I am starting life from scratch. Phiri had to endure many long queues in the five years as he had to apply for bank cards and the like as his cards were stopped when his ID was blocked. Phiri thanked the Echo for reporting on his story saying that it played a big role in helping him get to the bottom of the issue of his identity document.
