Three people were injured, one seriously, when a minibus taxi crashed into a house in Durban on Friday night, emergency services said. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said the minibus taxi was wedged between a wall and the house off Bishopstowe road in Glenwood. It is thought that the taxi driver may have lost control of the vehicle before it came to a crumpled stop, breaking through a house wall and window.
