Fresh "muthi" tied up with wool was among the items security guards discovered when they arrested a gang of alleged house robbers in Johannesburg on Tuesday. They were arrested shortly after their getaway vehicle – a charcoal Kia Rio - slammed into a tree during a chase. Police spokesperson sergeant Bongi Mdletshe said: "As they were committing the housebreaking, [security guards] who were passing by spotted the suspects and they fled, while the one who was carrying a plasma TV remained behind." They headed towards Rosebank when their vehicle crashed into a tree after missing a curve. READ: Three arrested for housebreaking The group attempted to run on foot but security guards nabbed them. "When we found them, we searched and recovered a screw driver; and when we searched their bodies they had all these intambo (pieces of wool) tied [to] their waists with fresh muthi. "Only R3 was in their pockets, so I am not sure if it's the inyanga (traditional doctor) that gave them that particular R3 in order for them to not get arrested. But we arrested them," Mdletshe said. The fourth person was arrested later in Parkview, Mdletshe added. Police are investigating a case of housebreaking, the possession of a weapon and the cloning of a number plate. The men are expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
