The Ithuba National Lottery has slammed reports that a University of Johannesburg student robbed them of R18 million using Photoshop and a fake ID. News recently spread that a student – who was allegedly working with an insider – collected the money by cloning three unclaimed winning tickets using Photoshop before fleeing the country. Public relations manager of Ithuba, Naledi Masopha, tells DRUM there is absolutely no truth to the reports. “Ithuba has become aware of the news that is currently being circulated, regarding a University of Johannesburg student who allegedly photoshopped a Lottery ticket and used it to claim winnings. We can confirm that no such incident has taken place. The news is fake. Furthermore, Ithuba has high-security measures in place that would immediately identify invalid claims of any jackpot and non-jackpot prizes.” Masopha adds that Ithuba have been trying to contact the publication that first circulated the fake news since Tuesday, but they have yet to receive a response. Meanwhile, social-media users have been excited over the news, with some even dubbing the student their hero.
