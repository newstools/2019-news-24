Best identified for its striking Nguni purple cow, the Capitalist Party of South Africa hinges on ten people, ten principles and ten plans to take a capitalist agenda to Parliament. The party's founders claim they are tired of capitalism being treated like a swear word, and tired of operating in a "tyranny of incompetence". They launched their bid in the hope of making it to the National Assembly with their entirely self-funded project. "Politics is too important to be left to politicians," founder Kanthan Pillay told News24. The party believes most of the country's current Members of Parliament would not be able to crack it in the "real" business world. Describing politicians as the "worst possible people" to run the country, Pillay believes it's time business people take their places in Parliament to "rock the boat a bit". He also spoke to News24 about why the ZACP wants high school students and women to get gun training, why the party rejects affirmative action, and the idea behind the party's bright purple cow branding.
