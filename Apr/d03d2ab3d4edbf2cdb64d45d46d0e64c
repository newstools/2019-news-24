Gqom artist Bongekile "Babes Wodumo" Simelane has been found guilty of contempt of court after failing to appear on assault charges last week, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said. NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara said on Monday that Simelane and her sister, Nondumiso Simelane, were found guilty and each of them were slapped with a R1 000 fine or 30 days in prison. Their co-accused, artist Tipcee (real name Thobeka Ndaba), was found not guilty after she produced a doctor's note. Kara said the three accused would return to court on April 24. They failed to appear in court on Friday for common assault. The assault allegations relate to charges opened at the Umbilo police station in March. It is alleged that they assaulted a woman during a gathering at a guest house in Umbilo. Brigadier Jay Naicker previously said four women assaulted the victim after an argument. The complainant opened the case of common assault on March 5. At the time, Naicker said detectives were in touch with Simelane who indicated through lawyers that they would provide police with statements. The charges against Simelane came just days after she went live on Instagram with graphic visuals of her partner, Mandla "Mampintsha" Maphumulo, launching a physical attack on her. Maphumulo was arrested on charges of common assault and briefly made an appearance in the Pinetown Magistrate's Court in March where he was released on R2 000 bail. Speaking to News24, the artists father, Reverend Mbongeni Simelane, declined to comment. "These matters are in the court. Because of that, I will not be commenting at this time."
