An Eastern Cape police officer has been charged with assault GBH (assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm) after a video surfaced over the weekend of an officer shoving, kicking and punching a female member of the public. The incident happened in Tsolo, about 40 km from Mthatha. It's not clear when it happened or what led to the altercation. Provincial police spokesperson Captain Khaya Tonjeni told News24 that Eastern Cape police noted the video and were "very disappointed at the behaviour" of the officer in the video. "Tsolo SAPS (SA Police Service) has since been instructed by the provincial commissioner to investigate the matter and to take appropriate measures and necessary disciplinary steps," Tonjeni said.

He said a case of assault GBH (grievous bodily harm) had been opened at Tsolo SAPS. Tonjeni explained that the complainant had not come forward, which was why police instituted a parallel process investigating the matter and pressing charges. "We made a decision to charge based on preliminary findings of being able to identify the person from the video and the conduct displayed," Tonjeni said. The officer has not yet been arrested. "SAPS members have a duty and responsibility to conduct themselves ethically and professionally whether on duty [or] off duty. This is also the case with police reservists," Tonjeni said. "The behaviour like the one depicted in the video is not acceptable and will not be tolerated within [the] SAPS family."
