Nyanga Management is appealing to Uber and Bolt (Taxify) drivers to be always vigilant and cautious when called to transport clients from or into the Nyanga policing precinct. Nyanga police spokesperson Captain Patience Sitshitshi said several hijackings of these taxi drivers were reported in the Crossroads area. â€œIn some cases, women are involved because they are the ones who would make a call and when the driver arrives the woman would come and inform the driver that she called for a relative and all of sudden unknown men would approach the driver, demand keys, rob and hijacked him. In some instances they would call and when the driver arrives a man or men would come rob and hijacked the car. In a recent incident, the driver transported an unknown woman to Crossroads promising him that the fare will be paid by another man when they reached the destination. While this man was paying more men came and forced the driver into the boot of the car and drove away. The driver managed to open the boot from the inside and escaped while the car was moving. Sitshitshi said during the past weekend a metre taxi driver was also hijacked by a regular client and his friends. The suspect also requested to be dropped at a destination and when they arrived he wanted to be taken to Crossroads. On the way back the client and his friends robbed the driver and drove away in his car. V Police are urging the public to report any information relating to these incidents by calling 021 380 3304/3374.
