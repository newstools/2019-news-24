Pupils at Hoërskool Driehoek in Vanderbijpark will walk under a newly built walkway on Tuesday. This as Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi will unveil the walkway to the school.

Previously News24 reported how an employee from the school said she was tormented by images of the falling concrete slab on that fateful day. The employee said she witnessed the tragedy soon after 08:00 when pupils left the assembly hall to return to class. "I was walking from the kitchen towards the bridge when I saw it collapsing. I heard a loud bang and I thought it was a ceiling board falling over my children. When I went closer, I noticed that it was not a ceiling board but it was a concrete slab. I quickly turned back and screamed for help," she said. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
