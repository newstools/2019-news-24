Western Cape police say they cannot rule out the possibility that a shooting at a petrol station in Kenilworth, Cape Town on Saturday, in which an unidentified 46-year-old man was killed, was gang related. Four men have been arrested following the incident which took place around 18:45. CCTV footage shows the man waiting in his blue BMW to fill up. A few seconds later, two armed men approach the vehicle from behind, with one of them opening fire from the left rear side. The second gunman fires a number of shots on the right hand side in the direction of the driver. He then approaches the driver's open window, and continues firing inside the vehicle. The two men then run off out of view. According to the police they fled the scene in a gold Toyota Avanza. Lieutenant Colonel Andr√© Traut said in a statement that after members of the public alerted the police, members of the Cape Town K9 Unit gave chase, which resulted in shots being fired between the police and suspects.
