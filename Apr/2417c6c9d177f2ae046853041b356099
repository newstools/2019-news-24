DISCRETENESS tests, which could lead to a break in the water supply for up to three hours per day, will take place at Humansdorp this week and St Francis Bay next week. The affected areas will be Boskloof and surrounds until today, KwaNomzamo from April 24 to 26 and St Francis Bay from May 2 to 3, May 6 to 7 and May 9 to 10. Kouga Infrastructure and Engineering Portfolio Councillor Freddy Campher said the tests were part of ongoing efforts by the municipality to reduce water losses. “Expert contractors have been appointed to conduct discreteness tests, aimed at optimising the water reticulation system and locating potential leaks,” Campher explained. “The tests can lead to a decrease in water pressure or interruptions in the water supply for up to three hours in the areas where the teams are working.” He said the tests were being conducted by the Re-Solve/EAS Joint Venture. “The teams are easy to identify as they will be wearing brightly coloured safety vests and carrying ID cards. They will also be making use of branded vehicles and will have a letter signed by Kouga Municipality, indicating the activities to be undertaken,” he said. “We ask that residents be patient while the tests are underway. They are necessary to help us reduce water losses and achieve water security for all residents.” The Kouga municipal area has been declared a drought disaster area. Water restrictions and punitive tariffs remain in place throughout the region.
