On Saturday 27 April the nation will be commemorating Freedom Day. The celebrations will mark 25 years since the dawn of freedom, where all races could participate equally in some of the countryâ€™s processes. It was on 27 April 1994 when South Africa held its first democratic elections and Nelson Mandela was elected the first black president.
