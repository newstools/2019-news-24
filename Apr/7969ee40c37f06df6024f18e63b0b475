 A 44-year-old man has been
convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment at the Durban High Court for
raping his relative. On 2 February 2018 the
14-year-old victim was alone at home at Emfume area, Amanzimtoti, when she was
approached by her relative who lived next door. According to KZN SAPS
spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, the victim opened the door as

grandmother and he was told that she was not around. The accused went away and
later he came back again. He forcefully entered the house and threatened the
victim with a pistol. He raped the young girl and then left the house. A case of rape was subsequently
