A Golden Arrow as well as a MyCiti bus went up in flames on Thursday afternoon in Cape Town and officials are still investigating the circumstances that led to both fires. Cushioned in the vicinity around Cape Town station, a Golden Arrow bus terminal was a hive of activity of a different kind, as commuters and passers-by stood around as firefighters contained the blaze. The fire comes a week after a train was allegedly set alight just metres away at Cape Town station. When News24 arrived at the scene, the fire had been completely contained. "Three fire engines, a rescue vehicle and 17 staff members were on the scene to battle the blaze," said City of Cape Town Fire and Rescue spokesperson, Jermaine Carelse. "No injuries were reported and the cause of the fire is unknown." Operations continued as normal as firefighters contained the blaze.   The shell of a burnt out bus in the Cape Town CBD.

Xoseni will appear again on May 2.
