A male teacher accused of sexually harassing female pupils at Grosvenor Girls High School in Durban has been suspended, according to the Department of Education. "We view all allegations of sexual misconduct extremely seriously and will investigate all allegations rigorously. We would like to appeal to the complainants to avail themselves to provide any necessary evidence during the investigation," Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said on Tuesday. Pupils demonstrated at the school on Monday and demanded that the teacher be axed. Mshengu said a team of senior officials was dispatched to the school to investigate the matter and gather more information.

Anyone who would be fingered to have committed any wrongdoing as it relates to these allegations, will be subjected to a harsh disciplinary action." He said the department would not tolerate sexual harassment or any form of sexual abuse. DA MPL Imran Keeka also claimed that when the girls raised the serious allegations, the school principal remained "indifferent to meeting stakeholders or to properly interact on this issue". He said the principal should also be suspended. News24 requested comment from the department about this, but the department said on Tuesday that it won't be providing any further comment beyond the department's statement.
