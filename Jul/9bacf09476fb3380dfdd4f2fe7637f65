A surfer in
his early 20s has had a narrow escape after he was bitten on his leg by what
appeared to be a juvenile great white shark while surfing at East Beach in Port
Alfred on Wednesday morning. "Ndlambe
municipal authorities, the SA Police Services, Gardmed ambulance services,
Ndlambe Municipal Protection Services and NSRI Port Alfred duty crew responded
to the scene, where the surfer was already safe out the water and attended to
by paramedics for lacerations to his leg," NSRI spokesperson Craig
Lambinon said in a statement on Wednesday. The surfer
was transported to hospital in a stable condition. Beaches
around Port Alfred have been closed until further notice as a safety
precaution.  GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
