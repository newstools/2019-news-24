A man accused of being a robber died after being set alight, allegedly by residents of New Brighton, in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape police said on Tuesday. Officers rushed to Stofile Street on Monday after receiving reports of a vigilante murder, said Captain Andre Beetge. "On arrival, a group of persons were found standing around the burning body of Sinethemba Gwatya," he said. "Next to him, a burnt toy gun and rocks were found." Beetge said nobody at the scene was willing to say who had killed Gwatya, but allegations were made that the 23-year-old had robbed people before he was killed by a group of residents. "Sinethemba had head and body injuries and his body was burnt using tyres by his attackers," said Beetge. "The South African Police Service cannot allow members of the community to take the law into their own hands. Any person taking part in acts like these will be arrested and charged with murder." Police were still investigating the attack and trying to establish the truth behind the allegations. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
