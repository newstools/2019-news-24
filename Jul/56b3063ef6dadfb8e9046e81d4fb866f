Human remains were found in a deserted house in Benoni last
week. The remains were discovered in a house in Mackenzie Park in
the East Rand, Gauteng on Wednesday 3 July after a neighbour alerted the police
of inactivity in the house. It’s believed the skeletal remains have been there for over
two years. According to Manogari Moonsammy, from the local Community
Policing Forum (CPF), the CPF received an urgent alert on WhatsApp on Wednesday
when the shocking discovery was made. The message informed residents that the street was inaccessible
due to a police presence. The house had been cordoned off while police attended
to the scene. Spokesperson of the Benoni SAPS, Captain Nomsa Sekele, confirmed
that the identity of the person whose remains it is, is still unknown. She says
investigations are still underway. “We’ve opened an inquest and we’re waiting for the forensic
report. That could take up to six weeks,” Captain Sekele says. An unidentified neighbour told Benoni City Times that she
hadn’t seen the occupant of the house for over two years, which piqued her
suspicions. Another neighbour who didn’t want to be named told the
local newspaper that the occupant of the house was a traditional healer. “The resident was well known, so we all became suspicious
when we stopped seeing the resident.” There’s been no confirmation that the remains belong to the
occupant of the house.
