Four security guards, who are accused of a revenge killing after one of their colleagues was killed in June, appeared in the Senwabarwana Magistrate's Court in Limpopo on Wednesday. They are facing charges of murder and attempted murder. According to the police, the security guards, Thabo Masilo, 26, Khetta Ngobese, 45, Sthembiso Hlabisa, 30, and Isaac Malema, 43, had received a report that one of their colleagues had been shot, killed and robbed on June 17. "Without reporting the matter to the police, they traced the suspected killer to a house in Mohodi Manthata village outside Mogwadi and accused him of being involved in the killing of their colleague in Senwabarwana and robbing him of his firearm," police spokesperson Constable Mienkie Ramakgoakgoa said in a statement. "They then allegedly interrogated the man and his friend about the incident, shot him in the chest killing him instantly and then shot and injured his friend before they left the scene." The police seized four pistols and three rifles when they arrested the accused. The case was postponed to September 27 for further investigations. All four accused were previously released on bail of R5 000. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
