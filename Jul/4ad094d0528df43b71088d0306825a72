THE over-enthusiasm of waste pickers at the New England Road dump site has frightened another person who was dumping waste. Jacques van Wyk (34) said he was terrified after his recent ordeal. This is the second incident of this kind this month, after a local man reported a similar experience. Van Wyk said he had taken garden refuse and general waste to the dump, and had driven into the section where waste is collected. He backed up his car so that the boot was facing the waste, when he saw about 15 people descend on his car. “They started banging on the car and trying to open the boot and the doors. There was no security anywhere.” Van Wyk then drove off out of the dump. His car was not damaged. “Luckily I was at an angle and I didn’t have to turn to get away. So I just put the car in first gear and sped off.” He said he had reported it to a security guard stationed at the entrance of the dump, who just laughed off the complaint. “I don’t mind them taking my refuse after I have dumped it. I don’t care about where it goes. But to bang on my car is something else. “It was terrifying. Even the dump isn’t safe.” Van Wyk said he used to visit the dump every week to dispose of waste, but will not go back. “I took my stuff to a dump in Prestbury. I’m too scared to go to this one from now on.” He said he had noticed waste pickers at the dump becoming more aggressive lately. “From the beginning of the year I’d notice one or two guys coming to see what you were throwing away, but now it’s 15 of them ...” Msunduzi spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said the City has not received any formal complaints about these kinds of incidents. She said there were security guards at the dump site itself. “We are working on a plan on how we can keep those who are rummaging away. We do have offices in the site where people can report [incidents]. Conditions at the site have improved a lot and we are still working on doing more.”
