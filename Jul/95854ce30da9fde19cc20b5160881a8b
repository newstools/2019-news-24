The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation has welcomed the two life sentences handed down to human trafficker Onyekachi Eze Okechukwu for the abuse and torture of two women. The Pretoria Regional Court handed down the two life sentences and an additional 39 years to Okechukwu last Friday. The Hawks' Serious Organised Crime Investigating unit arrested Okechukwu in May 2013 at his brothel in Pretoria, where he held the two women captive. They were taken to a place of safety after the operation, where they received counselling. "The two victims were subjected to witnessing and experiencing physical and sexual violence, threats and encouragement of their addictions," Hawks spokesperson, Captain Lloyd Ramovha, said in a statement on Wednesday.

Ramovha said it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that Okechukwu played a significant role in the trafficking of both victims and that he exploited their positions of vulnerability and physically and psychologically controlled them.
