The World Health Organisation on Wednesday declared the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo a "public health emergency of international concern," a rare designation only used for the gravest epidemics. "It is time for the world to take notice," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement, as he accepted the advice of his advisory board to invoke emergency provisions only used by the UN health agency four times previously. Those included the H1N1, or swine flu, pandemic of 2009, the spread 
of poliovirus in 2014, the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West 
Africa from 2014 to 2016 and the surge of the Zika virus in 2016. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it "welcomed" the decision. The body bag that saves lives It's designed to help combat the Democratic Republic of Congo's Ebola outbreak - the second largest ever. "While
 it does not change the reality on the ground for victims or partners 
engaged in the response, we hope it will bring the international 
attention that this crisis deserves," the IFRC said in a statement. The
 WHO's international health regulations, drafted in 2005, say that the 
international emergency label should apply to a situation that is 
"serious, unusual or unexpected; carries implications for public health 
beyond the affected State's national border; and may require immediate 
international action". More than 1600 people have died from Ebola
 since August 1, when the haemorrhagic virus erupted in DR Congo's North
 Kivu and spread to neighbouring Ituri.
