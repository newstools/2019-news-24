For five years Human Wildlife Solutions (HWS), an authentic and reputable company, has taken care of baboons very successfully and we all breathe a sigh of relief. Among the team of highly qualified, dedicated and innovative conservationists on the 13 strong staff are a doctor of zoology, BSc honours in biodiversity and conservation ecology, a BSc in botany and zoology, a plant ecologist, a biological control specialist, a primate behaviour scientist, a botanist and a behavioural ecologist. In addition, the famous Professor Justin O’Riain supports the staff from UCT (Univeristy of Cape Town) and the Institute for Communities and Wildlife in Africa, as he has a special interest in sorting out conflict. We are celebrating this month with HWS that throughout this period of hard work completed, we have been able to enjoy baboons which are kept within a boundary and no longer cause damage to our homes and dogs. Raiding baboons are extremely unpleasant, leaving faeces, urine and disease. Humans share the common whipworm – a gut parasite transmitted through the faeco-oral route. No more traumatised children, no more scratched cars, no more broken lights. We open doors and windows, the roof tiles and gutters, satellite dishes are in one piece. Sharing space with baboons is bad for people and baboons. In urban areas, they are killed by dogs, cars, electricity from phone wires and poisons. It is a romantic notion to wish to share an urban area with a baboon. It results in conflict and ultimately the reduced welfare and conservation status of baboons. So if one truly cares about wildlife, suggesting that baboons should be accepted in urban areas or controlled by unqualified people is in direct contradiction with all research evidence now available.
