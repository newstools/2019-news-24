OUR recent positive experience at Home Affairs, Greytown, needs grateful acknowledgement. From the capable and helpful man handling enquiries at the point of entry to the efficient staff who are to be congratulated for the way they handle such large numbers of people, coping so well under the enormous and relentless pressure, well done. When we received notification to collect our passports only two weeks later, we were doubly impressed. Thank you to all concerned. DIANE TOWERS Greytown
