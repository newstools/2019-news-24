A Twitter video of former South African cricketer Pat Symcox taking a swipe at the poor condition of a main road in Hibberdene, KwaZulu-Natal, has gone viral. The former spin bowler posted the video on Tuesday and by Wednesday afternoon it had been viewed nearly 6 000 times. In it, Symcox says Miami Road in the small South Coast town was hazardous and posed a danger to the public. He adds that a children's home is located near the badly damaged road and points out the risk of the exposed roadway. Symcox says: "That's washed away. This is the main road. And for those who may know this, Miami Road overlooks the sea. Right in front of it is a very famous place, it's been around for lots of lots of year, it's called the Mercury Children's Home."  He adds: "[This is] where people get looked after. Kids get brought every year. You may know that, some people may know where it is. But this, my friends, is what the road looks like, one of the main roads in Hibberdene. If people aren't unhappy about this, I'll never know. It's damn dangerous and somebody's going to get hurt here. And yet nothing's been done about it. A poor show." Responding to the video, Ray Nkonyeni Municipality spokesperson Simon April said the road formed part of a long list of roads damaged during the April 2019 floods. "It was therefore not budgeted for in terms of repairs [it requires major repairs]. The municipality is awaiting response from KZN's cooperative governance and traditional affairs department with regards to a disaster funding application with financial implications that was submitted in May 2019. Caution tape was installed, and it will be re-installed since it seems it had been removed." News24 has reached out to the department for comment, which will be added to this story.
