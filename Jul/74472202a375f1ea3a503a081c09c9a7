KOUGA Municipality has started trucking in water to the St Francis area following the collapse of a suspension bridge carrying a section of the main supply line over the weekend. Kouga Infrastructure and Engineering Portfolio Councillor Freddy Campher said emergency repairs were completed yesterday afternoon (Wednesday) and that water was flowing back into the reservoirs. “It will, however, take about two days for the reservoirs to fill up completely and the supply to normalise,” he said. He said the municipality had been able to maintain the water supply to the towns for almost five days thanks to residents using water sparingly and the St Francis Links making available water from its borehole. “By yesterday, however, the level in the reservoir had dropped so low that taps started running dry in high-lying areas. The municipality has, therefore, started trucking in water and will continue doing so until the supply normalises,” he said.
