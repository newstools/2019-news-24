The evening before his disappearance, a Johannesburg businessman, identified as Wayne Johnson, 42 but who also uses his married surname, Smith, had put soup in the slow cooker to cook overnight. The morning of his disappearance his husband, Charl Smith, had made him coffee to take to work. That was the last time Charl saw his husband. Wayne has now been missing for more than 20 days. "It was an ordinary day in our household – I never could’ve imagined that Wayne would just disappear like that," Charl told YOU.     On June 12 Wayne got into his 2018 Renault Clio and headed off to work. He disappeared somewhere in the north of Johannesburg. "It’s been more than three weeks and we have no answers. It feels like one long day from which I just can’t wake up," Charl says. Police have found a man in Kempton Park, east of Johannesburg, who was using Wayne’s cellphone and SIM. Wayne’s car was also advertised for sale on Facebook Marketplace but the person who posted it has since removed all ads on social media. On Saturday, Charl and about 70 of Wayne’s friends and acquaintances gathered at the Parkview Police Station in Johannesburg demanding answers. "We feel police aren’t doing enough to find Wayne. We’re waiting for answers we’re just not getting," Charl says.  Charl has hired a private investigator to help with the search. "He’s working with the police following up on leads." Captain Sifiso Mabizela, police spokesperson for the Parkview police, says five suspects have been identified. "We urge the public to keep sharing pictures of Wayne and his car on social media so that more people with information can come forward."
