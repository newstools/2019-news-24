Two alleged gang members are expected to appear in court soon for allegedly attacking an American investor in Johannesburg last month. Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said a police intelligence unit and team of detectives arrested the two on July 24 when they attended the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court to support one of their friends. "The Gauteng provincial police management formed a team of investigators who worked throughout until the arrest of two NDU Gang leaders in the Johannesburg court on the day of the court appearance of one gang member," said Makhubele. Thomas Mobille was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital after robbers in the city centre assaulted him, allegedly with bricks, on June 14. Mobille, who is a partner at Limiar Capital Management, travelled to South Africa to meet with several companies. His company invests in global emerging markets. His brother, John Mobille, who later arrived in the country, confirmed the attack to News24 and said several of Mobille's possessions had been taken. He said his brother was in ICU at a Milpark hospital and asked for privacy.
