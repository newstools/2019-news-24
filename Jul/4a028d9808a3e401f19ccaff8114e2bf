People across central Mozambique are struggling to rebuild their lives - four months on from two devastating cyclones. Nearly 650 people were killed and more than 160 000 were displaced after cyclones Isai and Kenneth tore through parts of southern Africa. Many are still waiting to return to what is left of their homes.  Flood-hit Mozambique in "urgent need" of large-scale international aid - United Nations United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs says as much as an additional $60,000,000 (approximately â‚¬5,500,000) will be needed to help repair the damage done to Mozambique by Cyclone Kenneth.
