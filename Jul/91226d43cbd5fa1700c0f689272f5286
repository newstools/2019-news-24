A surprise visit to Sebokeng Hospital in Johannesburg by Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku found improved services and the reduction of waiting times. Makhura and Masuku conducted the surprise visit on Wednesday as part of a commitment made in his State of the Province Address to create an "activist government". The hospital, located in the Sedibeng District Municipality, has been one of the premier's areas of concern following complaints from patients. "Since my last visit three years ago, I have seen some improvements, with the hospital getting new equipment that has aided the delivery of improved, quality patient care. "However, there are still some challenges. I have given the MEC 100 days to develop solid plans that will resolve healthcare challenges in the province," Makhura said. He added the focus of the sixth administration would be on improving the quality of primary healthcare as part of the provincial government's plans to overhaul the public healthcare system in Gauteng. The premier also visited a wastewater plant, following the intervention of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to repair the Sebokeng waste water plant and find solutions to decontaminate the Vaal River. "I would like to express my humble gratitude to the army for their patriotic work; for stepping in to assist our communities and ensuring that we resolve the sewer infrastructure problems on the Vaal River," added Makhura.
