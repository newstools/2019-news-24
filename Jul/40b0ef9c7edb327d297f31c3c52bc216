Community movement Gatvol Capetonian warns motorists and commuters of a planned shutdown of all major entrance roads into the City Bowl on Thursday 8 August between 05:00 and 11:00. Through this shutdown, the movement plans to get the City of Cape Town’s attention on the struggles of backyard dwellers across the city. “Over the last few weeks, we have been engaging poor and landless communities across the metro, the focal point being backyarders’ crisis government turns a blind eye on,” spokesperson Fadiel Adams said. A total of 17 communities across the city are said to take part in this shutdown. Among other things, the movement plans to address the lack of housing opportunities for coloured people, frustrations with the perpetuation of ‘apartheid-style planning’, total lack of housing opportunities close to work, and the continued manifold of the housing waiting list. “The objective of the shutdown is to expose government’s failure to meet deadlines and its purposeful failure to spend the housing budget,” Adams said further. He further urged public to understand that the shutdown is the only action the movement has at its disposal. “Our fight is for the land which belonged to us pre-1652, our patience has died. Brown [coloured] people demand their right to return home.” Gatvol Kenfac member Qanitah Otto said this shutdown is necessary because it shows how serious the movement is about their issues being met. “This is not just about housing issues, it is about the safety and security of people as well as creating job opportunities. I believe that this will get the attention of the relevant authorities,” she said. Otto further said that details of which roads would be affected by the shutdown had not yet been discussed and that a follow-up meeting will determine this. The City of Cape Town’s executive director for safety and security, Richard Bosman said the City did not receive any notice on the shutdown and is not aware of it.
