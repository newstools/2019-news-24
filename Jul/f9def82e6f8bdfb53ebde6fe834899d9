One person was killed and two others injured when three trucks collided on the R509, about 15km from Magaliesburg, Gauteng, on Friday. According to ER24 spokesperson Ross Campbell, paramedics arrived on the scene at 08:50 and found one trailer on fire and the stricken cab of another in the middle of the road. A man, who was in a minitruck, was found 5m away after being flung from it during the crash. Campbell said the man had shown no signs of life. Another man, who was a passenger in the minitruck, was treated and transported to a nearby hospital, Campbell said. "The driver of the cab found in the middle of the road sustained serious injuries and was flown by the ER24 OnePlan helicopter to a private hospital for further treatment." Campbell said multiple fire and traffic departments were also on the scene to contain the fire and control the situation. The police were also investigating the incident. Meanwhile, two people were killed after their vehicle was rear-ended by a truck on the corner of Wierda Road and the R55 in Sunderland Ridge, Centurion. Campbell said paramedics had found the two trapped in the car, adding both had sustained multiple fatal injuries. Two seriously injured teenagers, aged 13 and 15, were also found in the car. One of them was treated with advanced life support before being transported to a private hospital for further care, while the other one was airlifted to hospital.
