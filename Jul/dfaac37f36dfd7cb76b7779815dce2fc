A STERN warning is being sent to the members of the community to be vigilant of card skimmers. In Greytown, a man was defrauded of an amount close to R2 000 at the ATM last month. B-Secure officer Bongani Ngubane said: “We responded to a call where a member of the public was robbed at the ATM. We tried to check on the video footage but we were unable to trace the suspects. “We warn the members of the public to be vigilant when withdrawing money at the ATM. “We have noted that most of these crimes occur when the security guard is not around.” South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) CEO Kalyani Pillay said: “We are concerned about some of the increases, which clearly reflect that criminals will take every opportunity to get their hands-on bank customers’ money. Pillay offered some tips for clients using ATMS: • Take your time to complete your transaction and secure your card and your cash in your wallet, handbag or pocket before leaving the ATM. • Set a daily withdrawal limit that suits your needs (the default amount is set at R1 000), to protect yourself in an event that your card and Pin are compromised. • Check your balance regularly and report discrepancies to your bank immediately. • Avoid withdrawing cash to pay for goods/services as your Debit Card can be used for these transactions. You can use your Debit Card wherever the Maestro/Visa Electron logo is displayed. • Should you have been disturbed whilst transacting, immediately change your Pin or stop the card to protect yourself from any illegal transactions occurring on it. According to Sabric, in 2018, lost and stolen debit card fraud amounted to 42.5% of all debit card fraud and bank customers continue to fall victim to fraud at ATM’s while transacting. “To have any significant impact on the fight against all of these crimes, the collective efforts of banks, bank customers and law enforcement are imperative,” Pillay said.
