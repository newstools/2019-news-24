A massive fire has ripped through several farms in Taganashoek, Limpopo, destroying their crops. Joe Dryer from the Far North Bulletin told News24 the fire had started at around 16:00 last Wednesday and  had been brought under control at 17:30. He then received a message from a resident at 20:00 asking for assistance, as the same fire, which was located 25km from Tzaneen, had flared up again. By this time, there were many volunteers assisting the Mopani District Fire Department to contain it so it had not reached any of the structures on the property, Dryer told News24. Letsitele Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinator Mariette van der Westhuizen told News24 the fire was a result of an intentional counter-fire, which was ignited on a small farm. Van der Westhuizen said the wind had picked up and fanned the fire, destroying the mango crops on two farms. "They are not big farms, but this is these people's income. You're talking about three, four, five years before you are back on the same page. It takes a long time to recover from something like this." Van der Westhuizen said the fire department only saw to structural fires in the area and it was residents who had fought the fire on their own for over two days. The fire did not cause damage to any of the structures on the farm and no injuries were reported. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.
