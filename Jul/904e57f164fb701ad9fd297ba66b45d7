The body of a teenage boy was found in an embankment beneath a railway line in Naledi in Soweto on Sunday afternoon. He had a head injury and it is believed that the boy, 13, had fallen from a train that he had been travelling in, Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said. Paramedics rushed to Tsamaiso Street, near the Merafe train stop, at around 14:20 to find the young man at the bottom of the embankment, next to a stream. "Rescue workers had set up a rope and basket system to retrieve his body... The train tracks in both directions were shut down," said Herbst. At the end of May, a teenager was killed while standing on the roof of a train in Roodepoort, News24 previously reported. His body was found on top of one of the carriages. In January, a 15-year-old boy was killed near Maitland station in Cape Town, after he fell from one train and was hit by a second one.
