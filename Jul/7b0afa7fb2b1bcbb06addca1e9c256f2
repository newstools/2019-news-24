Visitors to the Lion and Safari Park in Hartbeespoort, north of Johannesburg, got a little more than they bargained for when a pride of lions got too close for comfort. "On this particular day, we had three young male lions that wanted to explore the vehicles and ended up climbing up on the vehicle’s bonnet," André LaCock, the park’s the general manager, told News24. In a video doing the rounds on social media, a pride of lions is seen approaching a white Jeep. They surround the vehicle. One of the lions suddenly jumps on top of the car. The driver then slowly reverses and, after a few tense moments, the lion finally jumps off the car and the rest of the pride backs away. LaCock said this particular incident was isolated. "Public safety is important to us and our staff is on the ground everyday making sure that this won’t happen again." He said these lions were new to the enclosure and got a little excited. "So, after the incident, we realised that they are still playful and they like to explore a bit." The lions were placed in a trailer and moved to a part of the park that isn’t open to the public. LaCock confirmed animal behaviouralists were monitoring the lions daily. He said there were no injuries as a result of the incident. "The customers are not upset. The vehicle is being repaired." The car sustained minor damage and the park paid the insurance excess. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.
