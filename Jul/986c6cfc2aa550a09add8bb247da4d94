Eleven suspected members of a "trio crime syndicate" were arrested after authorities received a tip-off that they were on their way to commit business robberies, Limpopo police said on Monday. Specialised police units, supported by local farm-watch structures, intercepted suspected members of the group as they were travelling from Gauteng to Makhado on Sunday evening, Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said. The officers recovered two motor vehicles that were believed to be stolen, eight station signal jammers, monitors used to control alarm systems, angle grinder wheels, a drill, balaclavas and hand gloves. "The origin of all the recovered items is still being determined through the ongoing police investigations," said Ngoepe. Police opened cases of conspiracy to commit business robberies, possession of suspected stolen motor vehicles, driving an unroadworthy motor vehicle, possession of signal jamming devices and possession of housebreaking equipment. The 11 people, aged 32 to 65, are expected to appear in the Louis Trichardt Magistrate's Court this week. Limpopo police commissioner, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba, applauded police officers and Bandelierkop and Soutpansberg farm watches for their swift reaction.
