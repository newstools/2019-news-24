FOR centuries, professionals have been querying the phenomenon of a learner who may have normal sensory, perceptual, cognitive and motor abilities, and yet have marked difficulties decoding (reading) and encoding (spelling) the written language. Parents of these children recognise their childrenâ€™s natural intelligence, but are puzzled as to why there is a problem with reading, writing and spelling. This paradoxical phenomenon is known as dyslexia. The International Dyslexia Association (IDA) defines dyslexia as a neurological-based, often hereditary, disorder that interferes with the acquisition and processing of language. It varies in degrees of severity and sometimes manifests as difficulties in arithmetic (dyscalculia) and handwriting (dysgraphia). Dyslexia has no boundary as regards geography, culture, socioeconomic status, language, gender or age. Quick facts about dyslexia . Dyslexia affects one out of five children (20%) .
