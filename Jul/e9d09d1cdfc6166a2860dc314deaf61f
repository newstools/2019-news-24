WITH Mandela Day coming up, the Haythorne Secondary School community along with various sponsors came together on Friday to feed the entire school. Teacher Annette Janneker said that many of the pupils that they are trying to help come from disadvantaged backgrounds and that the feeding scheme was a way to build and empower their community. “Nelson Mandela believed that education was one of if not the most important tools for success and we believe in this. “Our mission is to ensure that our pupils are not learning on an empty stomach and have the necessary and crucial tools to focus and do their work without any distractions,” said Janneker, who added that now more than ever, especially in winter, their pupils needed a hot meal. She also noted that with a lot of their pupils missing out on this basic right, it is important for more initiatives like this to be driven by the community. The school said that they would like to thank their various sponsors who came on board to make this feeding initiative a success and that they would be looking to make this a yearly project going forward.
