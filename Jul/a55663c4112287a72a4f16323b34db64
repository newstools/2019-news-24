Eleven fatal shootings have occurred in Philippi East in the Western Cape since Friday, prompting local police to initiate a 72-hour action plan. "The [plan] entails [a] lockdown and operations in the area that are conducted by public order police, [the] K9 Unit and Flying Squad members. From an investigation perspective, detectives [at] Crime Intelligence are hard at work following leads that could result in the arrest of the perpetrators of these incidents," police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said on Sunday.

A further appeal is made to community members to remain calm and allow the police to apprehend those involved."
