Three suspects were arrested in the early hours of Thursday morning and will appear at the Verulam Magistrate's court in Durban on Monday for their involvement in drug manufacturing and drug dealing. According to KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a joint operation by various law enforcement agencies led to the arrest of the three alleged drug dealers. During a raid at the premises suspected to be manufacturing drugs in Phoenix, North of Durban, police recovered drugs worth an estimated street value of R1 834 879, 25 buckets of capsules, heroin packaging equipment as well as R59 419 in cash. Lieutenant Zwane also revealed that a total of 24096 heroin capsules, 809 crack cocaine pieces, 1068 mandrax tablets, one and a half kilogrammes of heroin powder, four bags of cocaine, 287 ecstasy pills, three two-way radios, one unlicensed firearm and various ammunition were recovered during the operation. Speaking to East Coast Radio, the Anti-Drug Forum's Sam Pillay raised concerns about the effort made in drug busts and arrests not being equally met by the courts. "These guys work very hard to get the arrests done with large quantities. We are not finding the court doing their part to the best of their ability. The last time there was a bust worth millions in Springfield - the guys got bail of R5000. I hope that doesn't happen again. So we are worried about what happens after the arrest," he said.
