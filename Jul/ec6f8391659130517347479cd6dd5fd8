A community activist from Ottery, Keith Blake worked closely with a local business to help keep the homeless people around Parkwood warm during the stormy weekend two weeks ago. Blake received a bunch of 30 blankets from Diep River-based Grimms Auto Services. He had appealed to the company to support his initiative to help the less fortunate. Explaining how they identified their beneficiaries, Blake says: “My wife, Tina, picked them as we saw how poorly dressed they were, and we saw they had trolleys with plastics and cardboards which they got from bins to put food on the table.” Blake and his wife are pensioners and they spend some of their time trying to help the needy in their community. They have been working with this auto service for a while. Lilian Adams, a bookkeeper at the company, says the owners and staff are “very diligent” in donating to the under privileged. She said they have committed to the distribution of food parcels and blankets. “We do this very often and it is a great pleasure for us to be giving as best as we can,” Adams says. She says they believe it is important to share their blessings with those who are in need. Roxanne Thorpe, assistant manager says their donation was valued at R3 300.
