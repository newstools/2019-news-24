KwaZulu-Natal Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) MEC Sipho Hlomuka has ordered an investigation into an explosion at the Msunduzi City Hall on Monday afternoon. Hlomuka also condemned the attack. The municipality's administrator, Sibusiso Sithole, was meant to present a report at city hall when the explosion took place. "This is an act of terrorism, pure and simple. We cannot allow unknown assailants to paralyse our local government institutions and intimidate our officials and the general public," said Hlomuka. Sithole's report was meant to outline the municipality's turnaround strategy in order to restore it to "full functionality" after being placed under administration in April following governance and service delivery problems. Hlomuka said the municipality would remain under administration until such a time that "there is tangible movement in its fortunes". He added the incident had no place in a "civilised society". "We will not be intimidated by actions of individuals who seek to create chaos and sow discord. Our role is to support municipalities in this province and this is what we will continue to do. "However, we urge all our municipal officials to take the necessary safety precautions going forward," said Hlomuka. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
