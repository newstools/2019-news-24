Time Square Casino in Tshwane has disputed the version of events reported in the media over an alleged racist attack involving a South African model on its premises in the early hours of Thursday morning. The casino confirmed that an altercation had taken place around 04:00 on Thursday and said its security personnel had tried to break it up. This comes after The Sowetan reported that South African model Mirriam Ngomani was with her fiancé Tobias Zehetleitner at Time Square in Menlyn when a white man, believed to be in his 20s, took issue with their display of affection, as they were holding hands.
