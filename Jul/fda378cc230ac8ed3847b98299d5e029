Kids are Kids initiative decided this year to give thanks to crucial service providers in the community as part of their Mandela Day efforts on Thursday 18 July. The initiative is known in the Ocean View and surrounding communities for the work they do with the children of the under-resourced areas, as well as the homeless and the needy. In an attempt to spread the love and appreciation, founder of the initiative, Luke Koeries, took the children of the initiative out of their usual surroundings to visit the local police station in Ocean View, Fish Hoek Fire Station and Cape Medical Response to show their appreciation for the people who often go unnoticed in their efforts to help the community. Koeries explained: “We took them some treats and just spent time with them to thank them for the services they do.” He continued, saying that they also gave the staff at these companies a lasting token of appreciation. “We gave them some certificates of appreciation, to show that we are thankful for what they are doing in the community,” he said. Koeries also gave thanks to the companies who consistently help him to do good. “The companies that are always there and helping us on projects such as this are Attorneys West and Roussouw, West Point Properties and In2Food.”V Follow @kidsarekidsov on Facebook for more information and updates.
