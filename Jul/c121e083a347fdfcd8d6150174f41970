This week on POLOTIKI, we look at the raging battle between the Public Protector and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. Last week, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane released a damning report on Gordhan. She found him guilty of violating the Constitution through the establishment of the so-called SA Revenue Service (SARS) "rogue unit". Determined to clear his name, Gordhan filed an urgent application in the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, in which he asked the court to interdict Mkhwebane's remedial action and set aside her findings related to the "rogue unit". News24 senior political journalist Tshidi Madia and News24 politics reporter Lizeka Tandwa discuss this tug-of-war between Mkhwebane and Gordhan. They also look into eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede's extended leave and her supporters fighting tooth-and-nail for her reinstatement. Another hot topic is former president Jacob Zuma's much-anticipated appearance in front of the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture on Monday. While we know that Zuma will appear before the commission, we are not sure whether he will testify immediately. How do you see his appearance panning out?
