Zindzi Mandela has recently become quite the topic of discussion, but in between her controversial statements and interesting tweets, the South African ambassador to Denmark has also let us into her family’s personal life. Taking to her Twitter page, Zindzi shared a special moment that happened between the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and Nelson Mandela just before he passed on in December 2013. "When Tata took his last breath, Mama was holding his hand. A fact that the media will not share with the public," she responded to a tweep who had made a comment around the divorce of the two struggle icons. This revelation warmed the hearts of many, who were happy to learn that the two still had a bond despite their divorce and controversial differing opinions which were evident in 2010 when Winnie accused Nelson Mandela of ‘letting us down’. Others questioned where Nelson Mandela’s wife, Graca Machel, had been during the time.   GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
