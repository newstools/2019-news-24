Cape Town officials got more than they bargained for when they pulled over a minibus taxi driver in the city, only to find he had 30 outstanding warrants of arrest, the City's traffic services said on Tuesday. An inspector had stopped the Toyota Quantum taxi on the corner of Strand Street and Lower Plein street on Monday for operating without an operating licence, said traffic spokesperson Maxine Jordaan. Further investigation then revealed that the 32-year-old male driver, from Browns Farm in Philippi, had outstanding warrants to the value of R107 950. Jordaan said he was arrested and taken to Wynberg police station. His vehicle was also impounded.  GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
