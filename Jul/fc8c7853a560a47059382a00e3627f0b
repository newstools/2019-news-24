The ANC has paid tribute to "disciplined and fearless freedom fighter" Lesiba"Ike" Maphoto who passed away at the age of 88. "Bra Ike", reads the ANC statement, "belonged to that generation of selfless freedom fighters who were prepared to pay the ultimate price in pursuit of the liberation of their country," ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said. The ANC also sent condolences to Maphoto’s family and friends. After joining Umkhonto weSizwe, the military wing of the ANC, "he distinguished himself as a disciplined and fearless freedom fighter," Mabe continued in his tribute.  Maphoto spent 13 years in prison after being arrested in 1968. "His heroic and selfless contribution to the struggle for liberation will remain indelible in the minds of all freedom-loving South Africans. The nation owes Comrade Maphoto and his generation a debt of gratitude that we will never be able to repay in our life time." Mabe added: "The best tribute we can pay in honour of his legacy is to strengthen the ANC by devoting all our collective efforts towards the unity and renewal of our movement".
