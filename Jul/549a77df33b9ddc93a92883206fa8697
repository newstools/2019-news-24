The event at Petra Full Gospel Church in Sunnyside, Pretoria was attended by among others, local ward councillors, the South African National Civic Organisation, church leaders and the community police forum. Those in attendance agreed that high crime volumes in Sunnyside could only be addressed by close collaboration between residents, police and other affected parties. The chairperson of the body corporate at the once notorious Tambotie flat, Bongani Sarela, said measures that were put in place more than a year ago following their partnering with the local police had brought stability at that flat and others around it. "The robberies, scams and drug dealings at Tambotie are a thing of the past. Go to Tambotie now and you will be greeted by a completely different atmosphere," Sarela said. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.
