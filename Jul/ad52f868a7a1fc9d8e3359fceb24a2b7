Seventeen people were arrested by the Anti-Gang Unit during a sweep of Kensington in Cape Town after a shooting on gang turf on Thursday night, Western Cape police said. Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andr√® Traut said the unit and Kensington police sprang into action after the shooting, which took place at around 22:00 in Glider Crescent. Nobody was injured but police arrested brothers, aged 28 and 32, for possession of two unlicensed guns and ammunition. One has a pending attempted murder case and had been released on bail in that case as early as last week. Police extended their search for people wanted for various cases of possession of unlicensed firearms, possession of drugs, theft and house robbery, and arrested another 15 people. They are expected to appear in court soon.
