Police are investigating a case of murder after a man was gunned down in Lotus River last Thursday. In a statement, Captain Wynita Kleinsmith from the Grassy Park police station told News24 a white bakkie had approached 37-year-old Clayton Kippie before a suspect got out and shot him several times. A video of the incident shows a second vehicle pull up next to the bakkie before the suspect fires his weapon. The suspect is then seen getting back into the bakkie, before both vehicles drive off, leaving Kippie's lifeless body in the road. The police told News24 no arrests have been made yet.
