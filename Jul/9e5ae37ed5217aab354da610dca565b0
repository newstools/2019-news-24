A court bid by the Cape Organisation of Democratic Taxi Associations (Codeta) to interdict the City of Cape Town from negotiating a new contract for the N2 Express service was dismissed by the Western Cape High Court on the basis of urgency. In filing court papers, Codeta told the court its objection was with Golden Arrow Bus Service and its affiliates "as a result of widespread irregularities". Codeta claimed Golden Arrow had been operating the N2 Express route since the discontinuation of the MyCiTi service at the beginning of last month - an operation they deemed to be illegal. "Shortly after the matter was heard in court, the parties embarked on negotiations with a view to find a solution that would secure the resumption of the service as soon as possible, however this process failed as the divide between the parties and stakeholders was far too great," Codeta said in a statement. Codeta, the Route Six Taxi Association and Golden Arrow are part of a joint venture that were contracted by the City to operate the N2 Express service in terms of national integrated rapid transport guidelines. Mayoral committee member for transport Felicity Purchase stated Codeta had objected to the extension of the existing contract due to the composition of the joint venture. The City maintained it was doing all it could to bring an end to the impasse. "We continue to have constructive engagements with the stakeholders and anticipate a positive result. We are determined to get the service operating again as soon as possible," said Purchase.
