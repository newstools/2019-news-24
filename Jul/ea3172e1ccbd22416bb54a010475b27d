A horrific video has
gone viral of a little girl being flung into the air by a charging bison. The nine-year-old from Odessa,
Florida in the US, was visiting the Yellowstone National Park with
a group of 50 other people when the incident occurred, according to DailyMail. The girl was reportedly walking with two adults when a
bison grazing nearby abruptly charged towards her and tossed her in the air. The adults who were with the girl fled the scene. Fortunately the girl wasnâ€™t harmed, according to a
statement released by the park reported by Reuters. The unidentified girl
was treated by emergency personnel and later discharged from the hospital. In its statement the Yellowstone
National Park advised visitors to keep a safe distance of at least 23m from
bison. A woman was also gored by a bison in 2018, according to
CBSNews. Check out the viral clip below:  Sources:
