This week on POLOTIKI, we take a look at the week that was - and no other news dominated headlines quite like former president Jacob Zuma's testimony before the state capture commission of inquiry in Johannesburg. It's been an eventful four days. Zuma started giving testimony on Monday, kicking off his appearance with a lengthy statement in which he claimed there was a long-running plot against him. On several occasions he told the commission that he knew of plots to kill him. AS IT HAPPENED: Zuma retracts decision to withdraw from the Zondo commission WATCH: I warned Zuma - Hlaudi Motsoeneng Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng attended the state capture inquiry on Friday to show his support for former president Jacob Zuma. On Tuesday morning, he said his personal assistant had received a call after his first day at the inquiry, with the person on the other end telling her they were going to "kill" Zuma and his children. Then on Wednesday, Zuma's legal representative asked for an adjournment, saying his client had been brought before the inquiry "under false pretences".
