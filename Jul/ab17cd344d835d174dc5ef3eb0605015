Youth Connect, a Lwandle Migrant Labour Museum project, is expected to hold a discussion on what, to many, is an agonising daily reality. At the museum this Saturday (13 July), local youth will join their international counterparts to share their views on unemployment and entrepreneurship. They will interact with young people who have come to Cape Town through the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE), a non-profit promoting international education and exchange that builds bridges between individuals and nations, and opportunities for the exchange of ideas and experiences. On its website CIEE says it helps people develops skills for living in a globally interdependent and culturally diverse world, contributing to a more peaceful global community and good international relations. The discussion at the Lwandle museum will be on developing an education system that is effective in building the youth’s capacity and eligibility for employment and entrepreneurship. The day starts with a group of students from America touring the area before the discussion begins. Amanda Koba of the museum said the topic is very important as it affects both continents. “This topic has been on our list for some time, and we thought this the right time to tackle it,” she said. “For instance, last year we invited entrepreneurs to come and speak to our youth. “We want to see how best we can equip ourselves in an atmosphere of widespread unemployment, something that affects all of us. In dealing with unemployment some have taken the route to entrepreneurship and are not waiting to be employed.” Koba says hearing other experiences helps to widen one’s thinking on how best to deal with life situations one faces. “So, everyone is invited, and I am sure they will learn one or two things they can also implement, going forward,” she said. “Unemployment is a reality, and we need always to probe for better ways on how to deal with it.” The event is from 10:00 to 13:00.
