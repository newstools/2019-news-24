Fourteen pupils fainted at Masonwabe Primary school in Delft, Cape Town on Thursday morning and the cause is still unknown. According to the Western Cape Department of Education (WCED) spokesperson Bronagh Hammond, "It is not yet clear what has transpired; however, some reports have indicated that learners collapsed or fainted at the school." "The Health department has informed the WCED that the learners were taken to Delft Community Health Centre and Symphony Way Community Day Centre for further medical evaluation, and a minibus has also been dispatched to transport more learners to the day hospital," she told Drum. Currently, Metro Police, SAPS, Disaster Risk Management, medics and the schoolâ€™s social worker are at the school. Parents have also arrived to fetch their children. The WCED is appealing to the community to remain calm. "Right now our priority is to ensure that all learners are safe and that those needing medical attention are seen to. We await more information from medical professionals as to symptoms and reasons for their alleged ill-health," Hammond said.
