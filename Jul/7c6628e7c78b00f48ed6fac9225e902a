The police in Bloemfontein strongly warn members of the public to be extra vigilant when drawing money at ATMs. Several people reported being defrauded and robbed when drawing money. According to the police, a syndicate has been targeting people using ATMs at business places in Mangaung. However, the police are yet to arrest anyone. According to Sgt Ikobeng Hlubi, spokesperson for the Mangaung cluster in Bloemfontein, the victims could not identify the suspects and did not know how the perpetrators managed to withdraw money using their bank cards. “The police would like to advise residents that it is in their best interest to be vigilant to avoid becoming scam victims. “If safety precautions are followed, chances of becoming a victim can be lessened,” said Hlubi. “ATM users must avoid isolated areas, especially late at night. If you feel unsafe or suspicious of individuals loitering near an ATM, trust your instincts and leave.” She also advised people never to write down their personal identification numbers (pins). “It is best that people memorise their pins to avoid being defrauded. It is also advisable that people should not carry their bank cards, ID, passport and driving licence in the same wallet,” she said. “Never give your card or your pin to anyone for any reason – not even bank officials, security personnel or police officers. If you think your pin might be known to anyone else, cancel your card or change your pin. “Write down telephone numbers for reporting lost or stolen cards and keep them in a safe place,” said Hlubi. She encouraged people who have forgotten their pins to cancel a transaction at an ATM when they experience difficulty. “People are also advised not to move away from the machine before they have called the card stop number and to make a note of the reference provided by the bank,” said Hlubi.
