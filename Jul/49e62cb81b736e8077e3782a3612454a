WATCH: 'State capture inquiry is an exaggeration' - Jacob Zuma Former president Jacob Zuma has told the state capture commission on inquiry that there has been a conspiracy against him since the 1990s. He said this followed threats made against his senior counsel, advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, a week or so ago.   Zuma said he has lost a child before and that the commission should know that "my life, and my children, [and] lawyers are under threat". Zondo said the threats were "totally" unacceptable, adding that lawyers should feel free to represent their clients. "It is totally unacceptable that any threats should be made to anybody, and more so when those threats are made to or concerning a person who is giving evidence to this commission. "It is totally unacceptable for anyone to want to use violence to want to engage in all kinds of illegal means when they are unhappy about anybody... Our legal system is such that people can go to courts, can go to the police if they have complaints against other people." The hearing continued on Tuesday.
