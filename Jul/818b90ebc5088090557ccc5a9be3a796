A man who was stabbed at the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday has died, according to Western Cape police. The 21-year-old was attacked at around 11:45 and taken to hospital where he later died, Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut said. It is understood that he was stabbed beneath the collarbone outside a courtroom in what some said was a gang-related attack. Traut did not confirm whether the murder was linked to a case or to gang activity. In a video, which News24 has seen, the man can be seen lying on a bench inside a courtroom without his top on, as one woman appears to compress his wound and two others attempt to help him. Splatters of blood can be seen on some of the benches. Traut said the man's attacker is yet to be arrested.  GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
