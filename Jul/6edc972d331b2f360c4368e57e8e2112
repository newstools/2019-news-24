Matome Ramodise chased his stolen vehicle through the streets of Parkhurst, Johannesburg, for six minutes on Friday evening. Dashcam footage that went viral on social media shows the high-speed chase through the suburb. Ramodise, a businessman, was visiting a restaurant manager on 4th Avenue when he spotted his white Toyota Yaris pull up at a stop street nearby. According to him, he parked his vehicle near the establishment where car guards were stationed. "I was inside the restaurant for just over a minute when I saw my car pull up outside. When I got to the car guards who were standing where I parked, they told me they thought I was the one taking the vehicle." Ramodise told News24 that he jumped into the restaurant manager's vehicle, which was parked nearby, and they had begun to pursue the suspects. "Initially there were two suspects, but once we hit a dead end, one of the suspects got out." In the video, the stolen vehicle can be seen moving in and out of busy traffic, narrowly missing on-coming cars. They pursued the vehicle for about six minutes, before eventually losing it at the dead end. "I can't even explain how I feel about it. I can't sleep at night. In less than three minutes of me arriving there, they steal my car." Police spokesperson Sergeant Selby Makakase confirmed that a case of theft of a stolen vehicle had been opened up at the Parkview police station.
