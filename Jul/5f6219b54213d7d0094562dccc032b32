Free State police on Wednesday said that a man seen in CCTV footage being robbed at Bloemfontein Central Park had refused to open a case. In a video doing the rounds on social media, the man is surrounded by two men - one of whom is wielding a knife. After a brief struggle, the men enter a stairwell. One of the suspects holds the victim against the wall and goes on to search his pockets. The victim is then apparently forced to open his wallet and hand over the contents to the men. Police said the incident took place on June 20. Police spokesperson Brigadier Thandi Mbambo told News24 that they were aware of the video and had approached the man. "We spoke to the victim, but he is reluctant to open a case," Brigadier Mbambo said. She said, from the video, it didn't appear as if the man had been injured.
