Police are searching for three armed men after they robbed a pizza place in Pretoria on Thursday evening. CCTV footage of the incident shows the armed men walking into theÂ Pizza@450 restaurant in Mountainview and pointing guns at the employee on duty. According to Hercules police spokesperson, Captain Bonginkosi Msimango, the suspects pretended to be customers before pointing their firearms at the cashier of the establishment. Msimango said they took R1 500 in cash, beers, a ring and a cellphone before fleeing in a Hyundai Getz. "No shots were fired and no injuries were reported," said Msimango. "Thankfully the establishment has cameras that captured the incident. This will assist us in our investigation." The affected employee told News24 they would prefer to not comment so police could do their work unhindered. A case of business robbery has been opened with no arrests yet made.
