Charges have been withdrawn against Mandla "Mampintsha" Maphumulo in the assault case laid by his partner Bongekile "Babes Wodumo" Simelane, the National Prosecuting Authority has confirmed. Both Simelane and Maphumulo appeared in the Pinetown Magistrate's court on Thursday, after having initially ditched a court appearance on Tuesday. "The matter was finalised in that the charge against Maphumulo was withdrawn. This is because both parties adhered to the ADR [mediation] processs they committed to," said NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara. A warrant of arrest was issued for the couple on Tuesday, after they failed to appear in court.

He was arrested after a video of him launching a physical attack on Simelane went viral. The court ordered him to have no contact with her. However, since his previous court appearance, Maphumulo released a video on Instagram of a song called Khona Ingane Lay'Ndlini, in which it seemed that the couple had reconciled. The video featured Simelane, alongside DJ Tira and Campmaster. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
