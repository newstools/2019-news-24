A Cape Town panelbeater who allegedly sexually abused and raped several boys remains under house arrest as police gather further evidence, it emerged in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Monday. The widowed father of two, 58, who was arrested in January, cannot be named until he has pleaded to seven charges of rape and two of sexual assault. The boys, aged 12 to 18, were allegedly approached by the accused in Ottery in 2017 and 2018. They were apparently forced to perform oral sex on him and vice versa, and he allegedly touched their penises. In some cases, the boys were allegedly forced to penetrate him from behind. It is also alleged that he used the cars he worked on to pick up the boys. Prosecutor Nicky Konisi said they were consulting the victims. "There are at least six witness statements that still need to be obtained." The investigating officer also needed to download certain information and/or items from the accused's phone. Defence lawyer Asghar Mia objected to the request for a postponement, saying that the court previously heard the investigation was complete. Magistrate Goolam Bawa postponed the matter until September 5 for further investigation. The accused was last month granted R3 000 bail, which the State opposed. His bail conditions included not making contact with any witnesses and remaining under 24-hour house arrest at his residence and adjoining mechanical workshop in Kenwyn. The investigating officer could make unscheduled visits at any time. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.
