Soldiers underwent "mission ready training" on Monday after arriving in Cape Town ahead of their deployment to the Cape Flats to help police crack down on unrelenting gang-related and violent crime. On Monday, the SA National Defence Force tweeted that troops from the eight South African Infantry Battalion arrived, joining soldiers from across the country at the air force base in Ysterplaat. Minister of Police Bheki Cele said on Sunday the army would be on the ground in about two days after completing their orientation. Their job, he said, would not be to do the police's work but to support and accompany SA Police Service.
