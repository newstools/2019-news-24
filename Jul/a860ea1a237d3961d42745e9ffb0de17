The body of a
man, believed to be a stowaway, fell from a plane belonging to Kenya Airways on
Sunday and landed in London in the UK. It’s believed the
unnamed man hid in a compartment beneath the plane before takeoff in Nairobi,
Kenya, Metro
UK reports. Police and
airline officials says he fell from the landing gear of the jet as it
approached Heathrow airport after a nine-hour flight. He landed just metres
away from a man sunbathing in his garden in south London. “He [the sunbather] was so lucky not to be hit. It
would’ve killed him. The impact obliterated the stowaway’s body,” a friend
said. The 20-year-old
sunbather had been dozing off in the garden of the terraced house when the incident
happened. The body landed with such force it left a crater in the lawn, Sun
UK reports. The friend, who
was inside the house, said the sunbather initially didn’t realise what had
happened when they heard the huge impact. “The body
literally landed one metre away from him and there was blood all over the walls.
My friend was very shaken,” the friend added. Officials are uncertain
whether the stowaway was dead at the time he fell but he would’ve had to
survive nine hours with little oxygen at temperatures of around -60°C. “There have been rare cases where stowaways have
survived but often they lose consciousness because of a lack of oxygen and
hypothermia and then they fall when the wheels come down for landing,” a source
said. A bag, water and
food, believed to have belonged to the man, were discovered in the landing gear
compartment, Independent
UK reports. Police are investigating
the matter and trying to identify the man. Sources: Metro UK, Sun UK, Independent UK
