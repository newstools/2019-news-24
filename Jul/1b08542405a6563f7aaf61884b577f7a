The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) has called on police to find those behind the assassination of Bongani Cola, deputy chairperson of the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa (Demawusa). Cola was gunned down as he was leaving his home for work by unknown assailants on Thursday morning. "They did not take his car, which was idling outside the yard; they did not take anything in the car or from him. They shot him twice and left him in the pool of his blood," the federation said in a statement. Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said the 43-year-old was shot at about 07:00 outside his house in Rwaxa Street, New Brighton. "He was about to take his vehicle out when two shots were heard by his family inside the house. On running outside they [his family] found Cola fatally shot by unknown gunmen," said Beetge. He was shot in his abdomen and shoulder. 'Threat to status quo' According to the trade union federation, Cola, together with "a core of activists" have been making rapid progress in recruiting workers in the Nelson Mandela metro. "This undoubtedly would have angered the enemies of genuinely progressive, independent, democratic, campaigning and socialist-oriented forces. He became a threat to the status quo, and he had to be eliminated," the statement read. "We call on the SAPS investigators to leave no stone unturned to find those who assassinated Cola." A murder case was opened and is being investigated by the Eastern Cape provincial district Organised Crime Unit.
