A woman has been arrested in Boksburg in Ekurhuleni for allegedly selling R8 000 worth of dagga from a store in the area. According to chief superintendent Wilfred Kgasago, the dagga was packaged in brown paper bags and "seemingly" labelled according to "quality and origin". "Four EMPD (Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department) Community Liaison and Public Order Policing Unit members entered a shop in Rondebult Road on Saturday, 20 July in the afternoon and realised that the sales lady in the shop, among the wares she was selling, was dagga," Kgasago said in a statement on Monday. More than a dozen bags of dagga were confiscated and taken to the Boksburg police station. The woman, who cannot be identified until she has appeared in court, has been charged with the possession of and dealing in dagga and is expected to appear in the Boksburg Magistrate's Court later on Monday.
