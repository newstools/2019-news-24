THE SA Social Security Agency (SASSA) has identified potential fraud cases on 2 800 accounts from different banks and the SA Post Office (SAPO). In a media statement issued last week, SASSA said the vast majority of these cases were from the Eastern Cape. “As a precautionary measure, SASSA has requested banks and SAPO to stop payment on those accounts. “This was done so as to prevent fraudulent activity on those accounts by preventing funds from being drawn during the July payment cycle and subsequent ones if necessary,” the statement read. SASSA said that any innocent and affected beneficiaries whose payments had been stopped, were advised to make an affidavit at a police station. “The affidavit should confirm the correctness of bank details and account holder details. After making an affidavit, a beneficiary must take their bar coded or smart card ID, together with the completed affidavit to SASSA. Those using personal banks must bring along proof of banking details from their banks.” SASSA assured the public that there would be no beneficiary who would not receive a grant they were entitled to, due to fraud they did not participate in. “As soon as a beneficiary with a stopped payment has reported the matter, SASSA will facilitate a refund after an investigation has been done. “SASSA and its partners will remain on high alert to ensure that the right grant goes to the right person. “Beneficiaries are urged to work with officials and the police to report any criminal activity pertaining to social grants so that these fraudsters can be arrested and finally convicted,” the statement read.
