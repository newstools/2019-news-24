EFF MP Nazier Paulsen walked out of the Cape Town Magistrate's Court with a huge smile on Thursday afternoon after the State withdrew a laptop theft charge against him. "The State withdraws the charge," prosecutor Adiel Jansen said after consulting with senior officials earlier in the day during an adjournment. This, after Magistrate Reaz Khan refused to grant the State a postponement for the Director of Public Prosecution to make a decision. The court had warned the State last month that it would remove the 2017 matter from the roll if delays were not sorted out.
