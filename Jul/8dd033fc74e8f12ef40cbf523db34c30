ESKOM will switch off geysers for longer during the winter months as part of its efforts to minimise the need for loadshedding. Kouga Infrastructure and Engineering Portfolio Councillor Freddy Campher said this would affect local residents in whose homes geyser relays have been installed. “Starting this week, Eskom will switch off geysers for an extra hour - from 17:00 to 20:00.” According to Eskom, the move is necessary to minimize the risk of loadshedding during the cold winter months when electricity usage usually increases significantly. “We expect that they will be implementing this measure for the duration of July and August 2019,” Campher said.
