President Cyril Ramaphosa took his Mandela Day activities to the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital in Cape Town on Thursday, sharing a message of hope and positivity with the young patients, while at the same time assuring them that opportunities for people living with disabilities did exist. The hospital is a dedicated child health institution which offers a comprehensive range of specialist paediatric services to children. The president was an invited guest on the hospital's radio station, RX Radio. Ramaphosa immediately turned on the charm during his interview, as the young radio anchors put questions to him, ranging from the voting age, Nelson Mandela's legacy, and opportunities for people living with disabilities. "Never lose hope. Never think people do not care about your condition," Ramaphosa said. "We care about you and we want you to be positive and have a very forward looking approach to life, and to do everything you can to show other people that you are looking forward and you are positive." Ramaphosa, in a tweet, had explained why he had chosen the hospital to spend his time on Mandela Day: "A few months ago, I received an invitation from RX Radio, the Red Cross Children's Hospital Radio, to join them as a guest for a show. There can be no better day to honour their invitation than to spend my 67 minutes of #MandelaDay2019 being interviewed by these bright young minds." the tweet read. "We need to care for people living with disabilities and create opportunities for them to live and work," he said. He added that there was a big drive in both government and the private sector to make sure that such opportunities exist.
