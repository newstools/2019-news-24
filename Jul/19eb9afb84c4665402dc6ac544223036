Malema, in a mixture of English and Sepedi, says: "They say sex in English is nice, but when it is said in our language, you are using vulgar language. That is self-hate. Stop self-hate. Sex is sex. Whether unyoba or ke sex, it's the same. Sex is sex in any language. "Go to your rooms and have sex, take your alcohol with you. Your women are waiting for you, stop sleeping here," said Malema in Pedi. Malema confirmed to the Sowetan he was at the venue but declined to comment on his remarks.
