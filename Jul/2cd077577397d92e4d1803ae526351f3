THE weather last Wednesday played havoc with the PELFA Old Buck Gin Legends League, and only two games were played. In Tier A, Callies beat Central Acemates 3-0. Callies’ goals were scored by Kurt Petersen, Shane Jenneker and Shane Barnard. Central Acemates missed a late penalty. In Tier B, PE City got the better of Westpark 3-1. Siyabulela Mvunelwa opened the scoring for PE City and Siyabulela Mvunelwa made it 2-0 for City later in the first half. Lionel Terblanche pulled one back for Westpark, before Clifton Murphy scored City’s third goal, seconds before the final whistle. Callies have a bye tonight, but will retain the top spot in Tier A regardless of other results, as they lead the log by four points. Fairview Rovers will have to overcome Central Acemates to retain the second spot on the log. In Tier B, PE City face a tough encounter against St Albans to retain the top spot. Malabar Legends could displace City with a good win over Mahle Old Grey B.
