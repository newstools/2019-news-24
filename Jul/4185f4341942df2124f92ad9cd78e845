When two motorbikes pulled up and unleashed a hail of bullets into former Premier Soccer League (PSL) star Marc Batchelor's car on Monday night, his first reaction was to shield his gardener, according to his grieving brother. "There is one thing that can sum up my brother in a nutshell and that was his last moments on earth. He had his gardener with him that he loved and adored, and who cared for him and his dog. "The dog was in the backseat when the motorbike pulled up next to him. Marc's first reaction when shots started to fire was to instruct his gardener to get down. His first concern was for him," Warren Batchelor told the SABC on Tuesday.
