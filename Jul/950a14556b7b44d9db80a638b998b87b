An 18-month-old girl
reportedly plunged 46m to her death after slipping out of the arms of her granddad
while they were aboard a cruise ship. Kimberley Schultz
Wiegand from Indiana in the US was reportedly heard frantically “screaming in
pain” when her daughter, Chloe, fell from the 11th floor of the Freedom
of the Seas cruise ship onto a concrete dock, The
Sun reports. The ship was allegedly
docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico, when the incident occurred. Initial reports claimed
that Chloe’s grandfather, identified as Salvatore Anello, dangled her from a
window. "It's a very grave
scene, very regrettable and tragic," Elmer Roman of the department of public
security of Puerto Rico told local media. "One of the
grandfathers, whom it would appear was playing with the little girl, lifted her
out of the open window and lost his grip. But the South Bend Police
Department has said the claims are untrue. Chloe, who was
travelling with her parents, siblings and both sets of grandparents, reportedly
slipped from his hands after he lost his balance, Metro
reports. The toddler died on
impact. A witness revealed they
heard the parents’ anguished screams after the incident occurred, CNN
reports. “We heard the screams
of the families because we were close”, a fellow traveller said. “A cry of pain
of that nature doesn’t compare with any other cry.” The South Bend Police Department,
where the toddler’s dad is an officer, sent their condolences to the family. “The South Bend Police
Department offers its sincerest condolences to Officer Alan Wiegand and his
family during this difficult time following the tragic loss of their child
while in Puerto Rico,” a spokesperson said. “The department asks
the community to pray for the entire Wiegand family as they grieve and to
respect their privacy.”  Local police are
investigating. Sources: The
