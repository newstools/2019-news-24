Three men were seriously injured when they were ambushed in their home in Siyanda, Durban, on Tuesday night, paramedics said. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said paramedics had responded to reports of a shooting at a house off Inanda Road, and when they got there they were told that three men had been shot. It is unclear how many shooters there were, but paramedics were told the wounded had been rushed to a nearby clinic by members of the public. Herbst said one man was shot in the chest, and the other two were shot in their arms and legs. "All three patients were found to be in a serious condition and required advanced life support intervention to stabilise them," he added. They were taken by an ambulance to hospital for further treatment. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
