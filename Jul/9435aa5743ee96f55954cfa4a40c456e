The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has had a busy weekend responding to multiple incidents. On Friday, NSRI members found a mysterious trawler about 10 nautical miles (18km) off shore between Ponto do Ouro, in Mozambique, and Kosi Bay, in South Africa.

"The South African and Mozambique MRCC's (Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre) were informed for Telkom Maritime Radio Services to broadcast a maritime navigational hazard alert." The vessel beached on Saturday morning near Ponto do Ouro, Mozambique, and local officials were on the scene to investigate. Ship evacuation On Friday, a 56-year-old Filipino crewman fell down a flight of stairs and was evacuated from a ship approaching Port Elizabeth. "At 07:30, our sea rescue craft Spirit of Toft was launched accompanied by an Eastern Cape government health EMS rescue paramedic and we rendezvoused with the bulk carrier in Algoa Bay," said Port Elizabeth NSRI station commander Ian Gray. "NSRI rescue crew and the EMS rescue paramedic were transferred onto the ship and the patient, in a stable condition, and with spinal immobilisation, as a precaution, was secured into a Stokes basket stretcher." Made up mostly of volunteers, the NSRI performed 1 138 rescue operations in 2018 and rescued 1 620 people, according to its annual report.
