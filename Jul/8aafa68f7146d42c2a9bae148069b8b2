Two men have been arrested in connection with the alleged murder of their grandparents and arson after they set the couple's house on fire in Thaba Nchu, Free State police said on Thursday. The grandparents were found dead at their home in Moroka on May 6, police spokesperson Sergeant Martin Xuma said. "Upon arrival [at their home], police summoned the fire department and after the fire was extinguished the police found two bodies," he added. "The body of 71-year-old Mantwa Sebotso was found in the kitchen, while the body of her husband, 74-year-old Lethakong Sebotso, was found in the sitting room. "During a preliminary investigation it emerged that the couple had taken out a protection order against their grandsons as they were demanding money from them," Xuma said. He added police officers had arrested an 18-year-old man in Palm Ridge, Gauteng. His brother, 30, was taken into custody after the teenager was interrogated. The men appeared in the Thaba Nchu Magistrate's Court on Monday. They face murder and arson charges. The case was postponed to August 7 for further investigation.
