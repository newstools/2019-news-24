Guests travelling to and from the Kruger National Park (KNP) were advised that the Kruger Gate was inaccessible due to protests on Wednesday, South Africa National Parks (SANParks) said in a statement. The protests are taking place at Cork Trust, on the R536 road, leading to Kruger Gate. "Guests entering and exiting the park should please make use of alternative gates, such as Phabeni and Numbi gates, until further notice," the statement read. SANParks spokesperson Isaac Phaahla told News24 the protesters are not employees of the KNP and that the statement was issued as a precaution to visitors. "We don't know what the protest action is about," Phaahla said. "We are just issuing a general warning that people should avoid the area." Local police could not be reached for comment.
