A man has appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on a murder charge following a suspected gang-related knife attack in the court's corridors, which saw one man being stabbed to death. The accused, Christopher Hukura, appeared in court on Tuesday, when the case was postponed to August 6 to allow him to appoint an attorney. A 21-year-old man died in hospital after he was stabbed beneath the collarbone during the brawl last Wednesday. An advocate, who had witnessed the clash, said two groups had fought each other during a tea adjournment. He added he had seen a scuffle break out and knives drawn as the two groups attacked each other.
