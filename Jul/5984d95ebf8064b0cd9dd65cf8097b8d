Two convicted serial rapists have been sent for psychiatric observation at the Sterkfontein Psychiatric Hospital, while awaiting their sentences in the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg. Acting Judge James Grant ordered Mozambican nationals Phillip Jose Mlungu, 25, and Mduduzi Mhlongo, 35, to be sent for mental observation before the court could deliver an appropriate sentence. Mlungu and Mhlongo have been convicted on 16 counts of rape, one count of murder, four counts of armed robbery, five counts of kidnapping, four counts of attempted murder, one count of assault to cause grievous bodily harm, two counts of possession of an unlicensed firearm, and another two counts of possession of ammunition. Between November 29, 2016, and April 24, 2017, the two men went on a violent crime spree, in which they attacked six couples. According to the indictment, Mlungu and Mhlongo would attack couples at gunpoint and take them to a veld, where they would assault the male partner and then repeatedly rape their female partners. They would later rob the couple of their belongings, which included cash, cellphones, clothes and shoes.
