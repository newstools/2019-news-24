"Their mother was inside cleaning while they were playing. She checked on them once and they were still there, but the second time she went out, they were gone," Rechner told News24. "We don't know what happened or why. "We are concerned that they are out on the street, because of their medical background. If they can't speak, they can't ask for food or anything. People are unfortunately also inclined to be aggressive toward people with disabilities," Rechner said.
