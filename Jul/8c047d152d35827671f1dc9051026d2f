The ANC has paid its respects to struggle stalwart Vivian "Aunty Vivvy" Magdalene Sarah Daniels who died in June at the age of 82. Her memorial service on Thursday in Bellville South, Cape Town, was attended by, among others, Reverend Allan Boesak, former Cape Town mayor Theresa Solomons and former finance minister Trevor Manuel. Manuel, who spoke at the memorial service, said: "There's a lot in our history that we can look back on and be thankful for, but we mustn't revel in the past. "The past is a different country, we can't go back there. It's not about Aunty Vivvy in the past, it's a question of the lesson of Aunty Vivvy right now. It's a question about the quality of leadership, it's a question of the courage of leadership, it's the question of what matters when people take the responsibility of leadership," he said. President Cyril Ramaphosa, in a statement, said that Aunty Vivvy's selfless activism set a powerful example to leaders today. "We have lost a great stalwart and role model with the passing away of Aunty Vivvy. At the same time, her close and loyal relationships with - and work for - communities around Cape Town have ensured that her legacy lives on. "Aunty Vivvy was an outstanding servant of the people â€“ a leader whose humility and hard work motivated her only to do and seek what was best for the communities she served, without regard for personal gain or public acclaim," the president said. Vivian Magdalene Sarah Daniels began her life as an activist in 1980 when Wilfred Rhodes, another storied community activist, and a young Trevor Manuel, who were 43 and 23 respectively, got her involved in improving the living conditions of poor people in the Western Cape. Her house in Bellville South came to be known as a hive of struggle activity in the area, with issues such as houses without electricity, water, ceilings or toilets becoming major challenges to be tackled by her organisation, the Bellville Residents' Association.
