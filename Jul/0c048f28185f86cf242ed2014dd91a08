As former president Jacob Zuma prepares to appear at the state capture commission of inquiry on Monday, the commission is preparing tight security for the venue in Parktown, allowing only 200 people inside the building. "It has come to the attention of the commission that there may be large crowds of people who want to attend the hearings from Monday, July 15 to July 19," the commission noted in a statement. Therefore, the commission – headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo – will only allow 200 people into the venue, who will have to register before entering. The first 200 people will be accommodated on a first come, first serve basis. Anyone wishing to attend next week's proceedings will have to register between 07:30-09:00 at Camp for Christ Ministries, the statement said. It is still unclear what Zuma will tell the commission but, speaking to the SABC on Friday, Zuma said: "Truthfully, I was called by the commission to come say my piece, so we will meet there." The commission's statement said that those who did not make it into the venue would be able to access a live feed from a venue "that is a five minutes walk from the venue of the commission".
