A R25 000 reward is being offered by Johannesburg metro police for any information that will lead to the arrest and conviction of a man believed to be behind a break-in at the chief whip’s offices early on Saturday morning. According to Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) spokesperson Wayne Minaar, the break-in occurred just after midnight. The investigation had been handed over to the police and the Group Forensic and Investigation Service of the City of Johannesburg, said Minaar. CCTV footage from the office revealed a man dressed in a black jacket, beanie, sweatpants and black takkies, carrying items believed to have been stolen from the break-in. Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba asked in a tweet that people assist in identifying the suspect. A call reiterated by JMPD, with the cool reward of R25 000 for the apprehension and successful conviction of the perpetrator.  "Police are working hard in tracking down the suspect," Minaar told News24 on Saturday. He added that extensive damage had been done to some of the windows and doors of the premises. At this stage, according to Minaar, it was still unclear which documents had been taken. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
