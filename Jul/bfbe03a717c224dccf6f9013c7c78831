ER24 personnel and officials from other emergency services arrived on the scene at 06:20 to find the taxi laying on its side against a traffic light, spokesperson Russel Meiring said. "Most of the patients had already climbed out of the vehicle and were now found seated on the side of the road. "On closer inspection, medics found two men lying trapped inside the taxi. One man had already succumbed to his injuries, while the second man had sustained numerous injuries and was in a critical condition," Meiring said.

The injured people were transported to nearby hospitals for further care, while the critically injured man was airlifted by a private medical helicopter to a nearby hospital.
