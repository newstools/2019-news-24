Representatives of the Department of Water and Sanitation will clean the Renoster River and the Bloemspruit area as part of the Clear River Campaign on Mandela Day on Thursday (18/07). It concentrates on areas where a stream or river flows and the pollution occurs due to the dumping of garbage, causing danger due to polluted water.
