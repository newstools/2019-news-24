Lwandle police are calling on the community to assist in finding Ismael Sylvester, who went missing on Sunday 30 June. The 39-year-old man was last seen by his girlfriend after their metallic blue BMW (CA 608-204) broke down on the N2 opposite Asla Business Park. His girlfriend apparently left him in the car and went to find help, but when she returned, Sylvester and the car were missing. Lwandle police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Gama says the girlfriend tried to phone the missing man, but his cellphone was on voicemail. The Mitchell’s Plain resident and his partner were apparently on their way to hospital, as he was not feeling well, when the car broke down.

Sylvester has black hair and is 1,76 m tall,” Gama said. Lwandle police have opened a missing person’s report.
