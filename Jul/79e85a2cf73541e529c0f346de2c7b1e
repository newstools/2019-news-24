An assistant Master of the High Court in Kimberley was granted R4 000 bail on Friday after being arrested for corruption. Method Nkongane Gqwethywa, 49, appeared in the Kimberley Magistrate's Court after his arrest on Thursday. It is alleged that Gqwethywa extorted an amount of R15 000 as a bribe to assist two women who had approached the court to claim a deceased's estate. The women were referred to Gqwethywa by another official, said Hawks spokesperson Nomthandazo Mnisi. He then asked them each to pay him R7 500 upfront. The Hawks' Serious CorruptionÂ Investigation unit intervened after the victims approached and informed them of what transpired. Gqwethywa was then arrested and detained in police custody on Thursday, said Mnisi. He faces a charge for contravention of Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act 12 of 2004. The case was postponed to August 29 for further investigations. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
