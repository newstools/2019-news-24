The escalation of protest action on the N2 in Plettenberg Bay on Wednesday has led to the closing of municipal administrative offices and an increased effort by law enforcement to get protest leaders and office bearers of Bitou to meet and resolve issues. Protests which started in the early hours of Wednesday in Qolweni led to the closure of the N2 between the Shell Ultra City and Kwanokuthula, "due to sporadic stone throwing and fires on the road", the Bitou municipality said in a statement. "The situation remains volatile and tense, with some residents of New Horizons (Ward 4) that have also joined the protest." The municipality said that, in the interests of safety, a decision had been taken to close the municipal administrative offices. The municipality also said public order police management were leading attempts to get an undertaking from the protest leaders to meet with political office bearers in Bitou, which includes the municipal manager and the executive management team of the municipality. This was in an effort "towards resolving the issues that led to the protests, with the first objective to open the N2". The municipality said on Wednesday that various authorities were on the scene to "monitor the protest". These include the public order police, crowd management officials and provincial traffic officials. Traffic in both directions [was] still being diverted via the airport/Robberg Road from the Knysna direction and through Plettenberg Bay, from the Port Elizabeth direction, the municipality added. Last month, residents marched from Qolweni to the municipal buildings over service delivery. Organisers of the march revealed that high unemployment rates, the slow pace of housing projects and a lack of progress in sport development in their community were among the reasons for the protest.
