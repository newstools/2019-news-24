The Public Art Platform (PAP), one of the 2019 Vrystaat Arts Festival series of events, is changing Bloemfontein’s CBD in a raucous cacophony of colours and shapes by participating artists. The vibrant show underway at Hoffman Square, started on Monday (01/07) and ends on Friday (05/07). Blank canvases are nowhere to be found – instead the existing landscape is painted and overlaid with a whole new vision in which visitors and passers-by can delight. Fashion trends tailored by local designers are on display at this five-day event. Frenetic interventions create a push and pull in the hustle and bustle of our city centre, burning brightly to reconfigure the popular image of our town. The public are welcome to be part of the creative show. Volunteers of the PAP will lead you down the path, and have your eyes opened by an extraordinary group of artists testing the rules of the who and the what, and the how much more can take place in public spaces. The PAP events take place during the day.
