An ongoing assessment to determine the extent and nature of the damage on Franschhoek Pass in the Western Cape following a rock slide on June 22 will keep the road closed until further notice. Ntomboxolo Makoba-Somdaka, spokesperson for Transport and Public Works MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela, said the stretch of road would remain closed so as not to endanger motorists. "A geotechnical investigation is underway to determine the extent and nature of the damage," said Makoba-Somdaka. Inclement weather hit the Western Cape two weeks ago, causing damage to buildings and uprooting trees in various places.
