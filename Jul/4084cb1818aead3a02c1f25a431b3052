The MyCiti Bus regulator, Siyabonga Jubeju from Site B received the MyCiTian Award last Wednesday (26 June) for outstanding customer relations. This came after the City received numerous compliments from commuters about Jubeju and the exceptional customer service he delivers daily. The father of three children who started working for MyCiti in 2015 said the award came as a surprise to him. “They caught me by surprise. I didn’t expect it. It’s the first time winning an award since I started working,” said Jubeju adding that he is hoping that his award will encourage his colleagues to pull up their socks. Jubeju’s job is to assist commuters with logistical needs like bus time schedules, alternate buses and other queries. “At work, I’m one of the people informing the drivers which bus is going to be used and explains to the commuters if the bus is an express or all for stations,” he said. He described his work as challenging and needs patience. “Sometimes commuters come and share their stories with us (regulators) and we have to advise.” Mayco member for transport Felicity Purchase described Jubeju as a friendly person who dedicates his life to his work. “Two months ago he helped a family in distress after their car caught fire right across from the Artscape. He responded swiftly and put his own life at risk to douse the fire. His quick response saved the car from burning out,” said Purchase. She said a commuter once lost his business cellphone and Jubeju found it and called the last dialed number which turned out to be the number of the office of the correspondent. “Siyabonga’s story warms my heart. He epitomises service excellence and selflessness. He is a true gem by going out of his way to help people in need from our MyCiTi commuters to motorists,” she said.
