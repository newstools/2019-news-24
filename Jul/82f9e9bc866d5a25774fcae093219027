Employees at an Engen convenience shop in Pretoria were left stunned when a young man stormed the shop and proceeded to push over shelves and throw various products at staff members. When News24 reached out to the owners of the Engen garage on Duncan Street in Hatfield, they said the matter was handled privately, adding they did not want to comment about the incident, which happened in the early hours of Sunday morning. The video, which has been circulating on social media, shows the perpetrator angrily throwing items from the shop's shelves while some of the petrol attendants stare at the scene in amazement before a woman manages to dodge what appears to be a packet of biscuits that is thrown toward her. Captain Colette Weilbach of the Brooklyn police station said the incident was not reported to the police. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
