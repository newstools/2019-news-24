Grab a tissue! Something extraordinary happened to a woman when she visited a fast-food restaurant. Heidi Goforth from Tennessee in the US recently ordered some food for her son at a MacDonald's drive-through. After placing her order, she got an unexpected surprise, Daily Mail reports. The woman in line in front of her had paid for her order. Not only that, but the woman left a heart-warming note on the receipt. "My son is in the Air Force. I can't buy him breakfast, so I bought yours. Have a blessed day," the note said. After the kind gesture, the mom took to Facebook to share a picture of the receipt, News.com.au reports. "Good morning! I just had this happen to me," Heidi wrote. "It touched my heart so much! I was buying breakfast for my son at McDonald's and the sweet lady in front of me, in the drive-thru, paid for my meal. "I pray that you see your son soon! He's lucky to have a mom that loves him so much! God bless you and him! Tell him 'thank you' for his service."  Heart-warming message left on receipt.

"Kindness can create such a wave of emotion. How extra special that you were getting breakfast for your son!" "I briefly saw it when I woke but had to run to work. My husband texted me the news clip while I was working [the] night shift. "I cried like a baby when I read the comments from you and others! Not an hour goes by that we don't think of our son. He's going to laugh when he reads this," Caryn wrote. "My heart's melting! I couldn't imagine letting go of my son like that and imagining what he'd be going through," Caryn told Fox News. "I'm super grateful that she chose me to do that for and I'm overwhelmed with the outpouring of gratitude, support and love that everyone else has shown and expressed!"
