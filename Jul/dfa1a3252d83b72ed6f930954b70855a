A six-year-old boy was killed on Tuesday afternoon after he was hit-and-dragged by a bakkie on Magabe Street in Ikageng outside of Potchefstroom, North West paramedics said. When ER24 personnel arrived on the scene, they found the bakkie parked on the pavement, while the body of the boy was found underneath the vehicle, spokesperson Russel Meiring said. "Provincial Fire Services had to lift the vehicle to assess the child," Meiring said. "Unfortunately, the boy had sustained numerous fatal injuries. Nothing more could be done for him and he was declared dead. The driver of the bakkie escaped injury." Police were not immediately available for comment.
