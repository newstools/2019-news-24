The Neighbourhood Old Age Home (Noah), based in Woodstock, recently had an exciting makeover to make the premises more colourful for its residents and visitors. This was made possible by the global supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials PPG, through the PPG Colorful Communities Initiative. This saw Noah receiving a R375 000 donation to refurbish its facilities, a gesture that impacted over 300 social pensioners who reside on the premises. Staff, customers and suppliers collaborated on the Noah project and volunteered to spend their time refurbishing the walls, doors, ceilings, countertops and balustrades in the community centre, clinic and courtyard walls. PPG’s marketing and business development director Herman Putter said that not only was Noah in need of rehabilitation, its vision and mission aligned perfectly with PPG’s qualifying criteria for support. “Noah is so much more than an old age home; it is an innovative response to ageing,” he said. “The social enterprise development model creates opportunities for the pensioners to generate additional monthly income which ensures they lead purposeful and dignified lives.” Noah’s director Anne Dobson said the timing was perfect. “The elderly are most often lowest on the list of priorities, largely invisible, and usually ignored,” she said. She further said that everyone at the home was excited about the makeover which transformed “tired” old building spaces into vibrant, welcoming and contemporary places. Putter said that flexing real corporate philanthropic muscle is about giving more than just money and products, but includes time. “Our employees rally together to support the causes we get behind and by working together with staff and multiple partners, our impact has been magnified and for us, that is a great result. “As a cause, it was easy to identify with this project. We all have parents who raised and protected us when we were small and vulnerable. Now that role has been reversed.”
