EFF leader Julius Malema reiterated the party's support of its secretary general Godrich Gardee, during a press conference in Johannesburg on Tuesday. In June, CCTV footage emerged showing Gardee in a 2018 fist fight at the partyâ€™s headquarters. Malema said had he been involved in the scuffle, the situation would have been worse.
