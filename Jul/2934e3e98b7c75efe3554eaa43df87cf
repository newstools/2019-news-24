Kirk Louw, the father of 9-year-old Miguel Louw, has died - before the finalisation of court proceedings of the man accused of killing his son, according to reports. The boy went missing on July 17, 2018, in Sydenham. He was believed to have been kidnapped shortly after leaving school. Three days later, Mohammed Ebrahim was arrested but he denied any knowledge of Miguel's whereabouts. The decomposed body of the young boy was found on September 3 in a park in Longbury Drive in Phoenix, a stone's throw away from Ebrahim's home, according to News24.Â Ebrahim, who was allegedly the last person seen with the boy, was then charged with the boy's murder. Video footage shows Ebrahim buying Miguel KFC near his school in Rippon Road.However, it was not clear whether the boy entered a taxi with Ebrahim after visiting the KFC. The Post reported that Louw's father, 48, died of a heart attack on Tuesday morning, just 15 days before a memorial was expected to be held for his son. The boy's aunt, Tasneem dos Santos, told TimesLive that they were in shock as Louw Snr had felt chest pain and died before he could get to a hospital. He would be laid to rest on Saturday, the Rising Sun Overport reported. Ebrahim's trial was expected to get under way in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Durban in October.
