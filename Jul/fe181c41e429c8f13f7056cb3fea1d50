Five people were arrested for allegedly stealing 30 sheep, which were loaded into a taxi in Aliwal North in the Eastern Cape on Friday morning. According to police spokesperson Captain Ursula Roelofse, police followed up on information that the sheep were being transported in the taxi early on Friday morning. Roelofse said the five people were allegedly part of a syndicate operating in the Eastern Cape and Free State. The men, aged 22 to 39, are expected to appear in the Aliwal North Magistrate's Court on Monday. Deputy Cluster Commander Colonel Mpho Rabela commended the members on the excellent success as stock theft is a priority crime in the area. The arrest of the members of the syndicate will also make linkage to other cases possible, Rabela said. READ MORE:Â What the bleat!
