Winter in South Africa is in full swing, with back-to-back cold fronts bringing sub-zero temperatures to many regions. While the cold may be making some miserable, staff members of the Matroosberg Private Nature Reserve, situated 35 km outside Ceres, are rejoicing at the sight of snow. "We've been waiting all winter for snow," Heike de Kock, the reserve owner's daughter said on Thursday. "It never seemed to come, and then boom! It was white all over," she told News24. De Kock said "nice thick snow" started coming down on Tuesday. In videos sent to News24, one of the marshals is seen trying to make his way up the mountainside on a quad bike, but struggles to get through the snow. "We've been blessed beyond measure with a beautiful white mountain," De Kock said. "We are definitely hoping for so much more snow," she said. The reserve is popular with snow chasers hoping to experience the white stuff. Another cold front is set to follow the current one, causing a further drop in temperatures from Monday. "There is another strong cold front that is approaching from the far west. It will reach the Western Cape by Monday. It's going to bring bad weather conditions from Monday," South African Weather Service forecaster Bransby Bulo told News24.
