Police are investigating a case of assault and malicious damage to property after a motorist was attacked, allegedly with a hammer, by a taxi driver in Fourways. The incident took place on William Nicol Drive on Wednesday. The motorist, Mike Milford, said in a Facebook post that he was travelling to Lonehill around 15:00 when he was attacked. Before the attack, he said he had noticed the minibus taxi next to him skipping red traffic lights and disregarding the rules of the road. That was when Milford grabbed his dashcam to take a picture of the driver. The video's timestamp indicates the incident took place at 15:25. "He then noticed me photographing him and gave me the big finger," he wrote on his timeline. "As we approached Fourways Mall he overtook me on the left hand side and leaned out of the window with a hammer, threatening me and then threw it at my left hand side of the car." Milford added that the taxi driver then overtook his car and cut him off. "He then jumped out of his taxi with another hammer and ran to my car smashing my passenger window hitting my right hand as I tried to defend myself," he wrote. The video ends shortly after the car window shattered, causing glass fragments to scatter. Milford said he sustained injuries to his arm and the damage to his vehicle added up to a couple of thousands of rands. Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela said no arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing.
