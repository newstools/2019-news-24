Fed-up residents blocked roads leading into parts of Ennerdale, Zakarriyya Park and Lenasia South in Johannesburg as they protested on Friday morning against the occupation of land in the area. Traffic was diverted and many people were prevented from going to work. Ennerdale community leader Nolan Jafta said the local residents were angry because the government failed to act. "Land invasions are massive here. We see people arriving here in big cars to invade government land."

Another resident, Ellen McKay, said women were afraid to walk alone in the streets. '"Since we had land invasions, crime is increasing. We are being raped and robbed daily by criminals. "Some of those land occupiers are people who can afford to buy houses, judging by cars they are driving," she said. Residents also claimed people were selling government land for as little as R2 500.  GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
