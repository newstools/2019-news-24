Armed men threatened staff at a Hanover Park waste drop-off facility this week after their demands were not met, the City of Cape Town confirmed on Friday. The two men had demanded that staff allow them to take the recyclables off site on Thursday, said acting water and waste mayoral committee member Felicity Purchase. "When the staff refused, they drew their weapons and threatened them. There were also three armed men standing outside the premises," she said. The staff were told that the intruders would wait for them after work. Purchase said they arranged for staff to be transported out of the site to a safe location. The facility was closed on Thursday afternoon but open again on Friday. "This is the first time an incident of such a serious nature has occurred although staff have previously been verbally abused," said Purchase. "The City strongly condemns this incident that threatened the lives of our staff, who are working and making an honest living." She was extremely relieved and grateful that no one was physically harmed. Trauma counselling has been offered to the staff.
