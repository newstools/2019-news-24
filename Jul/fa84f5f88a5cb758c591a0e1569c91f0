Cape Town law enforcement officers who helped a woman chase down a man, who had allegedly stolen her bag, ended up arresting both of them when they found out what was inside. Members attached to the anti-land invasion reaction unit rushed to Olifant Street in Delft on Monday after they were told that people were being robbed there, according to law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason. Officers found a woman chasing a man. "The officers joined the chase and apprehended him. He was in possession of a white bag which the officers assumed was the property of the female who chased after him," said Dyason. ALSO READ: Dagga wedding cake and rusks?!

Mugging spree In a separate incident in Parow on Monday, law enforcement officials were told about five men who had just robbed someone of his expensive pair of shoes, said Dyason. "The area is a hotspot for opportunistic muggings, so the officers responded in numbers and searched the area for the suspects. They were spotted in Tygervalley Street busy conducting another robbery," he said. They were taken to Parow police station. "On arrival, another three public members were at the police station reporting they were also robbed. They identified the suspects as the perpetrators." Three of the five men were arrested.
