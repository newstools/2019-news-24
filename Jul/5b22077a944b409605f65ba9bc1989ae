A 30-year-old woman from Bela Bela in Limpopo has been arrested for alleged child neglect after her disabled 12-year-old daughter was found chained to a chair in a locked room. The police had received a tip-off on Tuesday from concerned residents who alleged the woman was ill-treating her child. They alleged the child's mother often locked her up alone inside the house, police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said. "The police reacted swiftly and found a disabled 12-year-old girl chained to a chair in a locked room [and] took the necessary steps to ensure that the child was safe. The suspect was then arrested immediately," Ngoepe added. While investigations are underway, the woman will appear in the Bela Bela Magistrate's Court on Thursday, where she faces a charge of child neglect.
