Former DA leader and Western Cape premier Helen Zille has joined the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) as a senior policy fellow, writer and analyst, it was announced on Sunday. "I hope to continue the battle of ideas outside of direct party politics and as such, I will be writing and speaking about liberal ideas and solutions to South Africa's problems," she said in a video clip. She added in a statement that the IRR provided a platform to defeat "racial nationalist and neo-Marxist ideas" by doing three things: uniting the middle, protecting property rights and promoting individual freedoms. Zille, who led the DA between 2007 and 2015, detailed where she would be focusing her influence.
