Two men have been arrested in connection with the hijacking of a delivery vehicle in Johannesburg, which the SA National Roads Agency (Sanral) managed to stop in its tracks. Sanral officials tracked the vehicle and alerted the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD), which arrested the men. CCTV footage shows suspects hijacking the delivery vehicle which is parked in an emergency lane. Sanral continued to track the vehicle until it showed JMPD vehicles closing in on it and arresting two men. A man who was lying in the back of the vehicle was rescued.

Minnaar could not confirm when the incident took place "but it did happen a few days ago", he added. "We commend Sanral for their effective work which led to JMPD securing an arrest of the hijackers soon after they committed the crime," Minnaar said. He was unable to say whether the men had appeared in court. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
