A runaway veld fire spread to the base of 5 South African Infantry Battalion in Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal, on Wednesday morning. South African National Defence Force spokesperson Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi confirmed the incident to News24. According to Mgobozi, the veld fire spread to the base around 04:00 on Wednesday. "The fire didn't start at the unit, it came from outside," Mgobozi said. "There was a lot of wind during the night that fanned the flames to the base. The municipality was called to assist in putting out the fire." According to Mgobozi, the damage was minimal and no one was injured. "The fire has since been extinguished. The only damage was to a building housing disposed equipment."   GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.
