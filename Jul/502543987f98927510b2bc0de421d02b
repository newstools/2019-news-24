A video showing children operating their own 'KFC drive-thru' on a North West farm has been melting hearts on the internet. The video was posted on Facebook by Rika Ernst on Sunday July 21, and racked up more than 344K views by Friday. Ernst, who is the mother of three of the children in the video, told News24 she didn't anticipate that the clip would draw such a huge response. She filmed the children acting out the adorable operation at their farm Buisfontein. The video was posted with the Afrikaans caption: "As iemand vandag te lui is vir kos maak... Bona Bona Buisfontein KFC is oop. Let wel, NET die 'drive thru'." "If anyone is too lazy to cook today… Bona Bona Buisfontein KFC is open, note ONLY the 'drive thru'," she said in the post.     From start to finish, the entire transaction is done in fluent Tswana, and Ernst said this is no accident. "I've got two very special ladies helping me to raise my kids... Gadifele Lobisa Kgasu and Florah Mokhatsi Selebano," she said. "They are part of the family... so I told them to only speak Tswana with my kids... and then they also learnt from the 'tjommies', who are like a real brother and sisters to my kids!" Ernst said multilingualism is a priority for their family. "I also grew up on a farm in the Eastern Cape speaking Xhosa... so I knew what it meant for myself... I  always said I'll make sure my kids will speak an African language," she explained. "I love seeing them play... it warms my heart... the same rules count for all of them but also the same love."
