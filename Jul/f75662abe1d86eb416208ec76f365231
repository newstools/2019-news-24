If you are attending the Durban July this weekend, be warned, KwaZulu-Natal police will not tolerate any form of criminality. "Spectators and horse-racing fans must behave themselves and enjoy the entertainments. No sharp instruments and no firearms are allowed in both events. The police will clamp down on those who break the law," police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said on Friday. The Durban July, SA's premier horse-racing event, is set to attract thousands to Greyville Racecourse, where entertainment, fashion and betting will take place. Gwala warned that police, event coordinators and security clusters had been planning weeks in advance for the event. 'Be aware of criminals' "All people attending the Durban July need to protect their valuables whilst at the racecourse. If they are indulging in alcohol they must be dropped off and picked up, or alternatively use a cab. Those found drinking and driving will be arrested." She said police were taking a proactive approach, which had previously contributed to the success of the mammoth event. "SAPS officers and personnel will be in and around both areas of events, as well as around Durban to tackle the problems which might disrupt the events. The racecourse gates will be opened from 10:00 and there will be other parallel events which will be monitored by police until the next morning." Despite the heavy police presence, Gwala urged attendees to remain cautious. "Whilst on the racecourse, they must be aware of criminals who may be mingling with the crowd, so don't leave any valuables unattended." Gwala also appealed to those using the parking facility to ensure valuables were not left exposed in their cars. "They must make sure that their vehicles are locked at all times." Roads near Greyville Racecourse – including DLI Avenue, Avondale and Gladys Manzi – will be closed.
