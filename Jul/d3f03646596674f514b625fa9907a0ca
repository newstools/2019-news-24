Eastern Cape police are investigating an incident in which a forensic pathology van was stolen, with a body inside, while the driver was relieving himself on the side of the road. The van was recovered in Mthatha in the early hours of Tuesday after it was reported stolen at around 20:00 on Monday, Captain Dineo Koena said. The driver reported that he had stopped the vehicle near Ngcingani on the R61 and left the ignition on while he urinated.

Fingerprints were lifted to probe whether there is more to the story.
