With the Lion King re-boot recently out at the cinema, a number of fans have been doing covers of the iconic film's soundtrack. One man in particular, has taken to social media to share his unique rendition of the popular song "Circle of Life". Travis Kinley, of South Carolina in the US, posted a hilarious video on Facebook of himself singing the opening lines of the popular song and to his surprise, his 3-year-old pet donkey joins in with him, Daily Mail reports. The video shows Travis somewhere on a farm with his donkey, Nathan, and other pet horses standing behind him. At first, Travis seems shocked but quickly continues singing with the animal - and the pair become a proper duet! The video, which was posted last Thursday, has received more than 1.9 million views, Billboard reports. "You can always tell he's a thinking animal," Travis said.  "He's just playful - that's just in his nature." The video was made after Travis' friends jokingly told him to sing a song from The Lion King with Nathan and his pet horses, wltx.com reports. So I got in the pasture, I gather all [the] horses . . . I start singing and Nathan starts to bray behind me, and I'm kind of blown away because we never do this together; we never sing together," he said. "He keeps going, so I keep going, and all of a sudden I just kind of break down laughing at the end." Travis said he's just happy to share his bonding experience with Nathan online.
