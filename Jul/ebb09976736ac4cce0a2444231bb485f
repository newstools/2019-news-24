Kouga Infrastructure and Engineering Portfolio Councillor Freddy Campher said work would start on the section of Woltemade Street between Jeffreys and St Francis Streets. “We expect the contractor to break ground next week, with all health and safety regulations having been put in place,” he said. “The expected completion date for this section is August 30.” He said the road would be closed for the duration of this period, from 19 July to 30 August. “We apologise sincerely to those businesses and motorists who will be affected by the closure. “ Alternative parking will be available at Neptune’s Terrace and the Ethios supermarket.” He said once the upgrade of Woltemade Street had been completed, the contractor would move on to Koraal Street. “We will be upgrading a total stretch of 1,7 kilometers, more than initially planned,” he said. The upgrade is a joint project by the municipality, MacRebur SA, SP Excel and Scribante Construction.
