The Brazilian
gang leader caught trying to escape disguised as his teenage daughter has died. Clauvino Silva
was found dead three days after his bizarre attempt to break out of jail
failed, Metro
UK reports. It appears the
42-year-old hanged himself with a sheet, according to Rio de Janeiro prison
authorities. They’ve opened an investigation into his death, NBC
news reports. Silva was the
leader of one of the most powerful criminal organisations in Brazil and was
caught over the weekend trying to pass as his 19-year-old daughter who was
visiting him that day. Creative prison break? Muscular inmate dresses as woman in escape bid from prison Could this be the most creative prison escape plan yet? Donning a female
silicon mask, a long dark-haired wig, tight jeans and a pink shirt, Silva had
almost managed to escape. Officials said
he’d reached the prison’s exit doors but his nervousness caught the security
guards’ attention, npr.org
reports. The video of his disguise being removed by prison guards then went
viral. After the failed
escape, Silva was transferred to a maximum-security prison where he was set to
face disciplinary sanctions. His daughter and
seven other visitors were detained over the foiled breakout. Silva was
serving 73 years for drug trafficking. Sources: Metro
