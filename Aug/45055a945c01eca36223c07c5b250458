Police in Johannesburg are on high alert after a group of shop owners in the CBD vandalised three police vehicles on Thursday. "The situation is calm at the moment, but we are monitoring it," Johannesburg Central Police Station spokesperson Xoli Mbele told News24 on Friday. Parts of the CBD spiralled into chaos after police conducted a raid on shops in Jeppe Street, which were allegedly selling fake goods. Among the products sold in the shops were fake versions of sportswear brands such as Nike, Puma and Adidas.

At one point police had to use rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Mbele said he hoped that shop owners would be more cooperative in the future. He said police weren't trying to be malicious, but merely doing their jobs. "If the police are doing their crime prevention duties, the public needs to respect the rule of law," Mbele said. No arrests have been made following the attacks. However, police are investigating cases of malicious damage to property and public violence.
