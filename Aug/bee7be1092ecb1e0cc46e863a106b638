The family of a Lwandle man who has been missing for three months are distraught, wondering whether their loved one is still alive. Bongani Boya left his Greenfields house in May and completed vanished. On the day, he quietly left the house so he would not disturb his sickly mother. The family thought he would return, but they haven’t seen or heard from the 43-year-old man. His concerned cousin Mlondolozi Duda took to Facebook, appealing to anyone who could help in finding Boya. When he left the house, Boya did not take any belongings with him and he has not been to his workplace, where he is employed as a gardener. “We have been to different hospitals such as Tygerberg, Groote Schuur and mortuaries, without any luck. We have not been able to find him,” he says. “This has been a great concern and we wonder whether if he still alive.” Duda said Boya had contacted one of his tenants in May and arranged to meet to collect the monthly rent payment. “But since then, he has never called or made any contact with anyone. Both his cellphones are on voicemail. His mother is old and ill, and came to the Western Cape for health reasons. His disappearance is taking a toll on her.” The relative again urged the community to help them find Boya as the family seeks clarity on whether he is unharmed. Anyone with information on his possible whereabouts can phone Duda on 084 988 7111.
