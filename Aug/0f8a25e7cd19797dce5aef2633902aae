A 9-year-old girl was hospitalised on Tuesday afternoon following a freak accident at a school in Carletonville. ER24 medics arrived on the scene at 15:04 to find that the girl had impaled her hand on a palisade fence, ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said. Members of the public had gathered and were assisting the child. Medics utilised a grinder that had been brought by a member of the public and began cutting the fence. After a short time, medics removed the section of the fence, freeing the girl. She was treated for her injury and thereafter transported to a nearby hospital for further care. It is believed that the girl had attempted to climb over the fence when she slipped and fell. The exact details are not yet known.
