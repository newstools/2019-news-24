The chief financial officer of the Limpopo Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Polokwane, Lucy Manana Seabi, 53, and her alleged accomplice, Mninikhanya Qwabaza, 42, appeared before the Polokwane Magistrate's Court for fraud and corruption on Wednesday. According to Limpopo Hawks spokesperson, Captain Matimba Maluleke, it is alleged that, in 2014, Seabi colluded with Qwabaza, who was a service provider, to draft terms of reference for the department's R1.3m IT tender. "She apparently further influenced members of the evaluation committee to endorse her preferred submission to the bid adjudication committee, which resulted in the appointment of a company owned by Qwabaza," Maluleke said. The department became suspicious and reported the matter to the Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation unit. "Seabi and Qwabaza were arrested following an intensive investigation and thereafter made a brief court appearance on the same." On Thursday, the accused were released on R2 000 bail each. They will appear in court again on October 11. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
