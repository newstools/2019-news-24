President Cyril Ramaphosa's Marikana massacre commemoration tweet has been met with a number of negative responses, with most replies saying it was ironic that Ramaphosa would send out such a tweet. Friday marked seven years since 34 mineworkers were shot dead by police during a protest at the then Lonmin Platinum's Marikana operations on August 16, 2012. An additional ten people, including security guards and police officers, were killed in the run-up to the mass shootings. "The Marikana tragedy stands out as the darkest moment in the life of our young democracy. Today we remember our 44 compatriots who lost their lives in Marikana seven years ago this week. Never again can we allow such a tragedy to befall our nations," the president tweeted.  However, Ramaphosa's tweet did not get the desired result, with people pointing out that he had been embroiled in the saga and a subsequent probe for sending an email calling for "concomitant action" against the protesting mineworkers at the time. Here's a round-up of some of the responses: "You called for CONCOMITANT ACTION, that's what we remember," tweeted @SicelMngomezulu.  You made the call, reacted @Zeekabane.  Some people, however, had a different view on the matter.   GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
