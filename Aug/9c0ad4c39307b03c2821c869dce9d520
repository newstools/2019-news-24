A Vanderbijlpark woman was pepper-sprayed in her car while she breastfed her baby because another motorist didn't like the way she had parked, EWN reported on Friday. Itumeleng Tsoeu reportedly said that she was parked at the Vaal Mall on Monday when an angry woman, a passenger in a double cab bakkie, hurled insults at her for her vehicle not being properly parked in her bay. She told the publication that the woman had reached for her bag and threatened to "shoot you and your baboon", before pepper-spraying her while she fed her 4-month-old infant.
