Three
men suspected of stealing cattle are dead after Dithabeng village residents in
Ga-Mphahlele, Limpopo, allegedly stoned and burnt them to death on Friday. According to police spokesperson Brigadier
Motlafela Mojapelo, nine heads of cattle were allegedly taken to the premises
of a family in the area by a man from the adjacent village of Makurung on
Wednesday. The cattle were taken there for safekeeping until a trailer could be
organised. "On Friday, the same man
came back driving a bakkie with a trailer and before he could take the cattle,
community members mobilised and accosted a 46-year-old woman, whose premises
was used to keep the said cattle, threatening to kill her. "In the process, she was let
go after she managed to point out the person who brought the cattle. The
already agitated community members allegedly grabbed the man and two others,
stoned them and set them alight," said Mojapelo. Police were called and, on
arrival, two men had already been killed and the third one was engulfed in
flames. He later died on the way to hospital. The provincial commissioner of
the South African Police Service in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba,
condemned "in the strongest possible terms, the brutal killing of three
unknown people by the residents", Mojapelo said. "[Ledwaba] has ordered that
the persons responsible for this inhuman act be hunted down and brought to
book. The police will be merciless when dealing with people who resort to mob
justice and kill those they suspect of being criminals." The victims are unknown and the
ownership of the cattle has not yet been established.  GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
