Traffic was heavy in Cape Town on Thursday morning after several routes were closed as part of protest action. Protesters burnt tyres and blocked roads throughout the metro. "Areas they said they are going to target include Beacon Valley, Tafelsig, Eastridge,  Woodlands, Parkwood, Lavender Hill, Kensington, Factreton, Ocean View, Elsies Rivier, Delft, Bo-Kaap, Ottery, Egoli informal settlement and Mamre," said Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa. Traffic and police officials have a strong presence in the city and are working to move protesters away. "SAPS and metro police are trying to resolve all the protests and get the protesters out of the roadway," Richard Coleman, media liaison for Cape Town Traffic, told News24. A number of roads still remain blocked: No protest violence has been reported. "So far, it's been very quiet. There's been no violence that we know of," said Coleman.
