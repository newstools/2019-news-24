At the time she went missing on August 9, 2013, she was enrolled for a Bachelor of Commerce degree in accounting at UJ. Madiba had spent the weekend at a friend Tshidi Mkwanazi's house in Phiri and was expected home in Diepkloof on the Monday evening. Her remains were found in a shallow grave at Mkhwanazi's home on December 16, 2015, after the police received an anonymous tip-off. Mkhwanazi claimed she had last seen Madiba on August 12, 2013, when she left in the morning to go to work. She said she left her with her uncle who was in her home at the time. Police took the uncle in for questioning but he was later released. According to reports, he had taken out a restraining order against Madiba's family, claiming the family harassed him about her whereabouts.
