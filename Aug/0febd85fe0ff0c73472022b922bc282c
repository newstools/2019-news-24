A female lawmaker was thrown out of Kenya’s parliament after bringing her 5-month-old baby to the parliamentary chambers on Wednesday. In a video shared by Citizen TV Kenya on Twitter, the lawmaker, Zuleikha Hassan, can be seen carrying her five-month-old baby as security guards gather around her and Kenya’s speaker of Parliament can be heard ordering her to leave the chambers. “Those members who are crossing the floor willy-nilly must know they are out of order,” said Chris Omulele, the temporary speaker of the house before demanding that Hassan leave the house. “The honorable Zuleikha, kindly withdraw with decorum.” According to New York Times, those who agreed for the lawmaker to be removed, cited a rule that bans people other than elected members from being inside the chamber, saying the regulation also applied to children. Speaking to CNN, Hassan revealed that she had been struggling to find a sitter for her child and had to attend the session. “I said, ‘Why should I stay at home and not go to work, just because of the baby?’,” she said before advocating for the government and the public sector to allow for family-friendly workspaces for mothers. “I was just tired. I mean young women all over the country are facing worse situations. They can't afford a nanny, and they have to decide whether they should breastfeed their child or go to work,” she added. “We are trying to encourage more women to come into politics, to come into the workspaces, to get out and help out the economy in other ways, so we have to support them,” she concluded. The incident has reportedly resulted in the protest of some Kenyan lawmakers who are against the decision made by the temporary parliamentary speaker during the session. Watch the video below.
