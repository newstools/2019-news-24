A CASE involving a man accused of making a racial remark to a Greytown businessman last year was postponed to September 23 at the Greytown Magistrate’s Court on Thursday, August 22. The matter was set for trial, however the magistrate presiding over the matter said the court could not proceed with the case due to the high number of cases enrolled before the court. In the case, Johan Olivier is accused of making a racist remark in a Facebook status written during the Diwali celebration last year where Olivier slammed his neighbour, Regesh Govender, for his use of fireworks. It’s alleged that Olivier said the fireworks caused distress to his pets and he allegedly called the festival “Coolie vaalie”. Olivier was charged with crimen injuria. Olivier appeared in court wearing a blue jacket and dark green pants. The court heard that the accused has been “harassing” the applicant with phonecalls in a attempt to solve the matter out of court. The magistrate warned the accused to refrain from contacting the applicant directly or indirectly, adding that if the accused disobeyed the rule, the applicant will make a sworn statement that will provide the court with valid reasons to keep him [the accused] in custody. “I asked him to have a meeting with me so that we can solve this out of the court. He told me that he would he available later. H asked me to come [to] his workplace. I went to his office and we talked. Thereafter I did not make any phone calls,”Olivier said. Govender, however, insisted that the accused has been making numerous phones calls, saying: “I told him to stay away from me.” The trial will resume next month.
