It took a group of 35 people just three hours to collect 128kgs of plastic bottles, 14kgs of bottle parts and 19kgs of polystyrene from the mouth of the Black River in Cape Town. Eco-warrior Chavonne Snyman, founder of the Plastic Pollution Initiative, helped lead the team of eco-friendly volunteers on August 17. The clean up was spearheaded by the Sea the Bigger Picture Ocean Initiative. Snyman told News24 that when the group arrived they were shocked by what they saw. "We found chip packets, shopping bags and blankets," Snyman said. The Black River mouth is located in the industrial area of Paarden Eiland below the R27 bridge in Cape Town. It flows through canals in Rondebosch, Claremont, Mowbray, Observatory and Maitland. "I am extremely, extremely sad," she said. The 38-year-old who works in marketing and advertising is so passionate about keeping the planet clean that she founded the Plastic Pollution Initiative, with the aim to eradicate litter from Cape Town's rivers. "Water is life...we need people to come and join us," she said.  GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
