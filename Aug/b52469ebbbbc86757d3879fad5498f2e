A couple never imagined that an evening that was meant to be relaxing at the local golf club would end with the husband in a deep coma in hospital. Zander Kotze and his wife Mienkie were at the Mbombela Golf Glub on July 7 when he and another local resident allegedly became embroiled in an argument. According to a source close to the investigation, CCTV footage shows how Zander and an unidentified man exchanged blows and later continued arguing in the club's parking lot. The source also revealed that at one point, Zander fell, hitting his head.Zander's condition has remained critical but stable since he was moved from Mediclinic Nelspruit to Mediclinic Muelmed in Pretoria on Wednesday. "Although his condition is stable, the doctor doesn't know whether he'll ever wake up from the coma," the source says. Police have confirmed to YOU that the man has handed himself over and was released on R2 500 bail. He's set to appear in court again on September 9 on a charge of attempted murder. Zander's family has offered a R10 000 reward to anyone with any new information about the incident. "Mienkie doesn't want to talk to anyone about the incident. She's not doing very well," the source says. "Zander's dad is also taking it hard. I can see him ageing by the day." Police spokesperson Captain Zandile Gwaqa has confirmed the incident and that the investigation is continuing. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
