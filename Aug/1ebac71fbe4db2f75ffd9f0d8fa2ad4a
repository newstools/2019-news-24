Scientists in Kenya say the northern white rhino is one step away from being saved from extinction. On Thursday, they successfully carried out a ground-breaking procedure of harvesting eggs from the worldâ€™s only two surviving female northern white rhinos. Sperm saved from the last living male northern white rhino, called Sudan, and a few others will be used to inseminate the eggs in an attempt to save the species. Al Jazeera's Sara Khairat reports.
