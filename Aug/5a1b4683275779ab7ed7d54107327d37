Nokubonga Blom from
Cape Town recently celebrated her birthday with the homeless. The 29-year-old, who
works with an organization known as Homeless Voices, visits
the homeless around Cape Town every Saturday to drop off donated clothes and
blankets. But it’s a tweet
of her heart-warming birthday celebration gesture that’s got everyone feeling
fuzzy on the inside. “I told them the last
Saturday that it’s my birthday and I wanted to celebrate it with them,” Nokubonga
told YOU. “And if you promise them something, it’s so important to fulfil it – not
just for yourself but for them as well because they’ve been so disappointed in
the past.” Nokubonga celebrated
her birthday on Sunday 18 August. But this time, instead of celebrating it with
her family and friends like she usually does, she decided to party with people she’s
built a close bond with. Nokubonga headed to Bellville
– with cake, sweets, chips and party hats – on her birthday to celebrate along
with everyone else whose birthday is in August but who aren’t fortunate enough
to have a little celebration. “They were so happy. We
sang, danced and they spoke about life. For me, that was so meaningful. “Having conversations
with people that’ve experienced life at its worst was the best birthday present
of all because they give the best advice,” she says.  Nokubonga’s brother
shared pictures of the celebrations on Twitter.
By the time this article was published, the tweet had been like nearly
9 000 time and more than 2 000 people were talking about it. “I was so overwhelmed
by their gratitude, they wrote me letters and couldn’t stop thanking me for
allowing them to share my special with me,” Nokubonga says.  She’d like to remind
people the homeless are just like everyone else. “They love to laugh, love to
love and most of all, they have hearts just like any of us. People need to stop
‘othering’ them.” Check out below, some of the heart-warming pictures captured from the day.   Sources: Twitter, Instagram
