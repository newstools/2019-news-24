After being unemployed for a number of years, Denny Nkwa, 29, from Burgersfort in Mpumalanga has found a unique way of earning a living - queuing for people who do not have the patience to wait in a line. Nkwa started his business, I Queue for You, this year but it is already booming. He now has five people working for him. "The longer I stay in a line, the more you pay," he told Move! His hourly rate is R50 and he targets snaking queues at the departments of home affairs and labour as well as the licencing department. "When they get there, they just look for an orange bib on which I Queue for You is written. I stand in the queue for them and when they pay I go to the next appointment," Nkwa said. "Being unemployed is frustrating. I was tired of not being able to support my family. Now, even if I have one customer, I know I can afford to buy bread in the morning for my family, I can feed my family." Nkwa studied engineering but struggled to find a job in that field. Now that he is able to support his girlfriend and 10-month-old baby, he said he was looking forward to growing his business. "My dream is to get help to create an app similar to Uber so that I can reach different people from different areas." Nkwa is also getting calls from people in different provinces but due to a lack of resources he cannot reach them all.
