South African expat in Zambia, Craig Wagner, was having the perfect day on Sunday. Wagner and his friends spent their day at Mindola Dam, fishing and enjoying the setting. At the end of the excursion, he had caught three fish. His perfect day quickly soured when he drove his brand new Toyota Hilux to the edge of the dam, onto the launch pad, so he could load his boat onto the bakkie. "I was still walking to the back of the vehicle and somebody screamed, 'Craig the car is rolling!'" Wagner says he couldn't believe what he was seeing. The car he had bought just a month ago was sliding into the water. "The pad is extremely slippery and even though the handbrake was up, the vehicle slid," he told News24. Wagner immediately jumped into the vehicle to try and stop its slide into the dam, but it was too late. "Your stomach sinks. You don't know what to think, you don't know what to do," he said about watching his car roll into the water. Once Wagner's vehicle stopped rolling, his friends helped him tow the car out of the water with a Toyota Land Cruiser. "We got it out and we sent it for evaluation and unfortunately it is a write-off. All the electrics are damaged completely," he said. Wagner said although he had the car for a month, he hadn't driven it for long as he was in South Africa for half of the time. "I've driven it literally two weeks," he said. Despite the the shock and sadness, Wagner is still able find a silver lining. "At least we did enjoy the day. And we caught three fish."
