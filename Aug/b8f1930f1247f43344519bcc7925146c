Mourners at a funeral of a 69-year-old man in Blinkwater village outside Giyani in Limpopo went on a rampage on Sunday when they discovered that his private parts were missing, Sowetan reported. James Makhubele was reportedly believed to have died in a hit-and-run on August 3, but family members now believe he was the victim of a ritual killing and that his body was thrown on to the road to create the appearance that he had been hit by a car. At the funeral, family members inspected Makhubele's remains and reportedly discovered that body parts were missing. This sparked a vigilante attack during which mourners burnt down three houses, one belonging to a man whom they believe to be the suspect and those of two of his employees. According to Sowetan, police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a second post-mortem would be conducted. However, a policeman at the local police station reportedly told the newspaper that the first post-mortem did not find that any body parts had been removed. Incidents of mob justice continue to flare up throughout the country. Last week, News24 reported that two men estimated to be around 30 years old were murdered by groups of people in separate vigilante attacks in the Eastern Cape. In July, 14 people were arrested in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria, for stoning a murder suspect to death. In the same week, two women were stripped naked and set alight in the Ha-Mashau village in Limpopo. They were suspected of murdering a 12-year-old boy. Two suspects, aged 16 and 17, have been arrested.   GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.
