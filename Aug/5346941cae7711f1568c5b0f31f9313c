A 13-year-old boy was
left with serious injuries after being impaled by a beach umbrella during a
family outing. The teen, whose name
has not yet been released, was at Gloucester Beach in Massachusetts on Friday 9
August when the horrific incident occurred, People
reports. In a statement released
by the Gloucester Fire Department, the umbrella was airborne before it pierced
the youngster’s shoulder. The boy was rushed to
the Beverly Hospital, Inside Edition reports. “When I saw what
happened I ran down and when I got there, there was a hole in the kid’s shoulder,”
eyewitness, Jacob Vargus, told 7 News Boston. “So I started to talk
to him, another lady started tying a tourniquet and others called the paramedics.” Another eyewitness says
they hope other beachgoers learn from this tragic incident. “These things,
unfortunately, happen all of the time. People don’t dig the umbrellas down
firmly and they can hurt you. “Hopefully this is a
lesson for people at the beach to seriously dig their umbrella poles deep into
the ground so they don’t come out and hurt anybody.” Fire captain Nick
Ouellette says the teenager was alert and calm when paramedics arrived on the
scene. “To my best guess, it
was a freak accident,” Ouellette says. The boy is expected to
make a full recovery. Sources: People, Inside
