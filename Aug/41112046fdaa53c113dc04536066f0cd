The Hawksâ€™ Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB) together with Crime Intelligence uncovered a clandestine dagga laboratory in Constantia on Monday 30 July. The joint team reacted on information about the dagga lab and conducted a search and seizure operation. This was carried out in line with Section 22(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA). During the search, the team found cannabis oil, dagga plant materials and seeds, as well as cannabis extracting equipment and chemicals. Computers and the lab equipment, as well as a total of R180 000 in cash, suspected to be the proceeds of crime, were seized. A Hawks spokesperson confirmed on Friday 8 August that they were following up on leads, but, as of yet, no arrests have been made. The investigation is still ongoing.
