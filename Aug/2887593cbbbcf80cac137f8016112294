DA leader Mmusi Maimane has slammed the Free State government for what he calls an administration which has become a conduit for theft, misappropriation and fraud. Maimane was on the campaign trail at the Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality, which was placed under administration last year after it went "bankrupt", News24 previously reported. The DA will be contesting by-elections in the area next on Wednesday next week and Maimane used his visit to gain support. "A vote for the DA is a vote for a party with a proven track record of delivering in government. "That is the DA difference and change you will see if you put your trust in a party determined to put a job in every home and deliver clean government and basic services for the people of Maluti-a-Phofung," said Maimane. He said the municipality was faced with rising unemployment numbers, rather than one which was booming in areas of manufacturing, tourism and education. "The ANC government have been at the centre of this jobs crisis in a municipality that has only ever received a disclaimer from the Auditor General. "That means that in almost 20 years since 2001, no opinion has been given regarding the financial statements of the municipality," Maimane told supporters at the public meeting. "The DA will be contesting all 15 wards in the area and pledge to deliver good clean government, effective management and an obsessive focus on economic development, investment and job opportunities."
