Simon Rudland, co-owner of Gold Leaf Tobacco Corporation and member of Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association (FITA), was seriously injured in an apparent assassination attempt in Johannesburg on Wednesday morning. FITA chairpersonÂ Sinenhlanhla Mnguni confirmed the shooting to News24 on Thursday. According to information supplied to News24 by a credible source, two assailants in a white car waited at the offices of FITA in Norwood, Johannesburg. As Rudland and his lawyer arrived for a FITA meeting, one man fired nine shots with a handgun to Rudland's head area. One bullet struck him in the neck. He has since been hospitalised and is being kept in intensive care. The source said the suspects have been identified by way of CCTV. "It comes as a shock to all of us," Mnguni said. "At this stage police are investigating. This is something we take seriously." Mnguni said Rudland has not yet been able to communicate as to what exactly happened. He said he would speak to Rudland during the course of Thursday morning. "We have to allow Mr Rudland to recover."
