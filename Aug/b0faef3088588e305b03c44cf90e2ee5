A man suspected of being involved in the murder of Cape Town horse rider Meghan Cremer is known to the family of her friend, Linda Mohr. Questions arose about the Mohr family's relationship with the suspect, Jeremy Sias, 27, after it was discovered that he was Facebook friends with Mohr's son. "Jeremy was born and grew up on one of our family member's farm in the area alongside ours. He was a labourer on our bottom farm but had no dealings with our stud and livery clients. "As a family, we are not only reeling about losing our dearest Meghan, but now the knowledge that Jeremy was involved has come as a huge shock to us all," Mohr said in a Facebook post on Thursday.   Cremer's body was found with her hands tied up and a restraint around her neck at a sand mine in Philippi on Thursday. News24 reliably understands that one of the men led detectives to the site where she was found.

The police arrested Sias, Charles Daniels, 39, and Shiraaz Jaftha, 34, on Tuesday after they were found with a stolen vehicle that was registered to Cremer.
