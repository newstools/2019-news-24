Arthur Babaev
allegedly had his pal filming him on a railway line as a train passed over him. The vlogger,
who’s since been arrested with his friend, identified only as Dmitry, filmed
the terrifying event between Salar and Chukursay railway stations in the
district of Yunusabad in Uzbekistan. In the footage
the young man is seen lying on the tracks just as an oncoming train passes over
him. The video,
shared on Instagram,
achieved more than 34 000 views and sparked outrage on social media with many
netizens calling the vlogger a “bad example” for teenagers and young people. Local
authorities said Babaev, who has more than 5 000 followers, made the clip to
create hype in his attempt to become an online influencer and wanted to see his
video go viral. The two friends
have reportedly since been detained by police and charged with petty
hooliganism. Watch the video
