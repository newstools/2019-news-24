Rape-accused televangelist Timothy Omotoso and his two co-accused,Â Lusanda Lusani and Zukiswa Sitho, have lost their application to compel the State to provide them with further details of the charges against them. The application was made by their lawyer, Peter Daubermann, and in it they demanded more information on intricate details of the allegations against them, including when and where the offences allegedly happened. Judge Irma Schoeman gave her ruling in the Eastern Cape High Court in Port Elizabeth on Thursday afternoon, ordering that the trial continue as scheduled on Friday. "I will give short reasons for my ruling now, and will only give detailed reasons during my final ruling," said Schoeman. Schoeman said the provision of further particulars must be fair to both parties. The State cannot provide particulars if it is not known to them, she said. She was of the opinion that Daubermann was deliberately being obtuse. Following her ruling, Daubermann asked the court to postpone further so he can prepare for the trial. The trial continues as scheduled on Friday. Acting National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Sibulele Mboyi said they welcome the judgement. "The Judge has expressed our sentiments that the information provided to the legal representatives of Omotoso and his two co-accused is indeed sufficient," said Mboyi. "We truly are satisfied with the outcome, now the trial can continue tomorrow and the accused can plead." GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
