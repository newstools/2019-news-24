A murder suspect was killed and burnt in an alleged incident of mob justice following the discovery of a teen's body parts in his fridge. According to Mpumalanga police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the boy went missing on Saturday at Alexandria Trust, Marite, near Hazyview, and the community immediately conducted a search. They later discovered his body, with some missing body parts, in an open field near a dam within the area. "It is then that two boys informed the community that they spotted the boy walking with the man, who is well-known in the area. They (the community) then apparently hunted the man down, brutally assaulted him and set him alight. He died on the scene," Hlathi said. "The incident is suspected to be a retaliation by the community after the murder of a 13-year-old boy, whose body parts were found hidden in a fridge at the man's house." Police were alerted about the incident and upon arrival at the scene, they were attacked by the angry mob as they tried to quell the situation.
