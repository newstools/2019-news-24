A new forensic pathology laboratory, which is currently being built in Johannesburg, will be one of the biggest facilities of its kind in the world, says Gauteng Premier David Makhura. Makhura visited the construction site of the new Johannesburg forensic pathology laboratory in Auckland Park on Thursday. According to a statement, the R500m state-of-the-art facility would replace the current Johannesburg forensic pathology mortuary in Hillbrow that was struggling to cope with the demand for forensic pathology services in Johannesburg. Makhura said the 650-person storage facility would also serve an academic function with auditoriums, workspace and medical procedure observation rooms for medical professionals and students. "This project will uplift the community and assist medical students to do their research. The most important part the building design has taken cognisance of the stressful nature of the environment," he added. Once completed, the forensic laboratory would transform the spatial landscape and link tertiary education sites across the province by adding to existing amenities such as the Ann Lasky Nursing College, Helen Joseph Hospital, University of Johannesburg campus; Campus Square Shopping Complex and Rea Vaya station complex, which have become both an educational and health precinct in the Auckland Park area, Makhura said. "This will make it one of the biggest facilities of its kind in the world." GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
