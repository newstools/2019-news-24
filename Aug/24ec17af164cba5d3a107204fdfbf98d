The Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department (EMPD) arrested three men and confiscated over R600 000 worth of crystal meth and dagga. The arrest came after the EMPD Drug Enforcement Unit received a tip off about a batch of drugs intended for distribution in the Germiston area by three people. The information was provided by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks), an independent police directorate responsible for combatting serious organised and commercial crime, EMPD Spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wilfred M Kgasago confirmed. Using the description, provided by the Hawks, of the three people who would be transporting the drugs, the EMPD Drug Enforcement Unit placed the suspects under surveillance to monitor their movements, from 09:00 on Friday, August 2.
