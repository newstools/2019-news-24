An unidentified
man is wanted by the Kazakhstan police after climbing a fence at a zoo and jumping
onto the back of a giraffe. A clip of the
incident, which took place at the Shymkent Zoo in Kazakhstan, has since gone
viral. In the clip,
the visitor can be seen climbing a fence in an attempt to get onto the giraffes
back. The visitor,
who’s believed to have been drunk at the time of the incident, successfully
manages to get on the animal’s back. He remains there for a while and can be
seen stroking the giraffe’s neck. The majestic animal
then suddenly gets spooked and dashes forward, throwing his passenger off its
back.  In the last
seconds of the footage, the giraffe can be seen coming back towards the scared
man and he then quickly scrambles over the fence where he escaped before he
could be arrested. Local media
said the man had been drunk at the time. Police
confirmed they’re trying to identify the man who faces arrest over the stunt. Source: Magazine Features
