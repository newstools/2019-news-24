Harrowing CCTV
footage has gone viral of a teenager getting electrocuted while holding his
cellphone. In the video
taken in a restaurant in East China, the boy is seen clutching his Huawei phone
in his hands moments before he was electrocuted. The
13-year-old, who’s since been identified just as Liu, can be seen sitting in a
booth dressed in a bright green T-shirt and holding his phone, which is plugged
into a wall socket. Seconds later
Liu’s body jolts and he becomes totally rigid as he’s apparently getting an
electric shock from the smartphone. Later he slumps
back in his seat – still with the phone in his hands – as his friend walks over
to check on him. According to
reports, Liu was pronounced dead at a local hospital after doctors twice tried
to revive him. Paramedics
confirmed he’d died of an electric shock which stopped his heart. Investigations
are continuing as authorities try to determine whether the shock came from the
cellphone, the charging cable or the wall socket. It’s not known
whether the boy's parents are taking legal action.  Source: Magazine Features
