The 10-year-old school boy who helped a struggling recycler push his heavy trolley up a hill has received a special award at his school. James Hefer, a pupil at Pridwin Preparatory School in Melrose, Johannesburg, was given the Knight of the Week award. "It is awarded to the person who lives out his school's values in the best way possible," headmaster Selwyn Marx told News24. James received the award on Friday. "We try to teach our boys their reason for coming to school is to learn what their strengths are, what they are best at, what they are good at, in order to make the world a better place," Marx said. He told News24 he did not know of James' kind act until he saw the video, which went viral. James's mom, Dale Hefer, captured the moment after fetching her son from soccer practice. "On our way back at about 16:30, we were driving through Craighall Park and there was this poor guy who was trying to manoeuvre this enormous load up this hill and it was turning in on itself and collapsing," Hefer said.  James immediately wanted to help and Hefer stopped her car so he could get out. "He stood next to this guy and put his weight behind it," she said. "He helped and pushed it up the hill." Hefer said they were very aware of Johannesburg's "trolley men". "We are very aware of these guys, we drive around a lot and we're very conscious of them and admiring of them and always try to give them money, clothes or a blanket," she added.
