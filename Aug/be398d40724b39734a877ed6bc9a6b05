A horrific
video of a three-year-old has gone viral after he accidentally fell into a
manhole. The CCTV video
from the city of Zunyi in China’s south-western Guizhou Province shows the boy
being rescued by his dad on 1 August. In the dramatic
footage, the family of three, whose names are not known, can be seen walking on
a pavement to avoid a manhole. The boy’s mom
and dad go around the manhole, which has a cracked metal cover, but the little
one stops next to the sewer entrance before deciding to jump right on it. The youngster
breaks the cover and immediately falls into the manhole, leaving his parents
panic-stricken as they peer down into the ground looking for him. His father
tries to climb in but is apparently unable to fit his body into the huge whole. He then turns
around and lies flat on the ground before reaching his arm into the sewers. A second later,
the tot re-emerges in his dad’s arm and his relieved mom collapses and starts
crying. The boy, who was
soaking wet, didn’t suffer any injuries, according to reports.  A nearby
clothing shop owner, who watched the incident unfold outside her business,
later offered the boy a change of clothes. Local
authorities are still looking into the case, but reports said that the local
government had already sent workers to install a new manhole cover. Source: Magazine Features
