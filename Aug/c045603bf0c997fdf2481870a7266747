IN light of Women’s Month, Mountain Rise resident Nazneen Hussain will be facilitating and hosting a Pietermaritzburg Family Eidgah­, which is an Islamic prayer offered on the morning of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. “We only started this project in 2017 and already it has grown immensely. We are hoping to attract lots of women, especially considering that it is Women’s Month,” said Hussain, who added that the community project was started with women in mind, with the focus being on empowering women to be active during these spiritual gatherings. “We want women to take on more of a role during these spiritual gatherings and to enhance their lives while providing a space for single or widowed women who may feel alone or left out.” The family Eidgah is open to all of the public, including men, women and children who want to take part and enjoy a special moment. Those looking forward to the occasion can begin making their way to Mountain Rise Primary School through the Royston Road entrance at 6.30 am with the prayer ending at 7 am on August 12. “Please make ablutions at home and bring your own prayer mat. The general public are advised to dress warmly and a tent will be provided in case of rain. “Men and women will be accommodated separately,” said Hussain.
