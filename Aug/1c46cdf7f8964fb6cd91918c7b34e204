A Norwegian woman has died tragically after being struck by lightning during an ultra-marathon in Italy. The 44-year-old woman, whose name hasn't yet been released, was competing in the Südtirol Ultra 120km Skyrace on Saturday 27 July, Daily Mail reports. In a Facebook post, race organisers revealed that the competitor was struck by lightning between aid stations, and track marshals had no way of reaching her. The race had reportedly been cancelled 30 minutes before the freak incident occurred, People reports. Organisers had been stopping the runners at aid stations along the route but the woman wasn’t informed of the cancellation and had continued running. "About 30 minutes before the accident, the race had been stopped due to the weather conditions and the athletes held up at Antran, the Rifugio Punta Cervina and the Rifugio Kesselberg," Südtirol Ultra Skyrace said in their statement on Facebook. "Some athletes though were on their way between these spots and couldn't be reached by the track marshals. Among them there was the group with the Norwegian runner."  Runners phoned the emergency services to get urgent help for the woman, Daily Mail reports. "After first aid the injured athlete was flown by rescue helicopter to Bolzano hospital, where she died from  her injuries." According to Runner's World, severe storms that hit Italy over the past weekend killed three people countrywide. Sources: Daily Mail, People, Runner's World
