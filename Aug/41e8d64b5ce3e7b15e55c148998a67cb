Members of Women Ministries from Seventh Day Adventist Church of the Central Peninsula 1 District marched on the streets of Gugulethu in an effort to raise awareness against abuse in the area. The march started at NY 3 near Qabazi and ended at Gugulethu Comprehensive School where the event was held. The district encompasses churches from Gugulethu, Nyanga and Philippi. Event organiser Vicky Arosi said it is an annual event celebrating Women’s Month. She said they aim to encourage people to stand up and fight against abuse. Arosi described abuse as something that infiltrates and destroys many communities. “Many people suffer abuse in silence. They don’t speak out till it reaches the stage where a person suffers from depression,” she said. She said abuse has no gender, it affects everyone. “People are suffering different kinds of abuse such as physical, emotional, financial, domestic violence and sexual abuse. “We do assist people who have problems by referring them to psychologists or social workers,” said Arosi adding that they also link with spiritual healing. An attendee Phumza Temba said as a church they have youth clubs where they educate them about life skills. “Our clubs are based on age groups. We have a club for those who are aged four to nine which we call Adventurous. From the age of 10, they are called Path Finder. And those who are 16 to 21 years are called Ambassadors. “Above 22 up to 35 are called Youth Ministers. We are teaching them career guidance and spiritual healing,” she said. Temba described drug abuse as a major problem among young people. She said she doesn’t have to be a church member to join their marches. “Anyone who is interested and wants to make a change to his or her life and the community at large is welcome,” said Temba.
