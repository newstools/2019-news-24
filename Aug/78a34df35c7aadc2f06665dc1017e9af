Murder charges against Newcastle Mayor Dr Ntuthuko Mahlaba were dropped in the eMadadeni Magistrate's Court, northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), on Thursday, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said. Mahlaba was arrested in March in connection with the 2016 murder of ANC Youth League member Wandile Ngobeni. Mahlaba was at the time charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. KZN NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara said the charges were dropped because one witness had died, while another four decided not to testify. Six people were on the State's witness list, who, according to the NPA, had implicated Mahlaba. "The decision to withdraw the charges comes after careful consideration and analysis of all evidence obtained in the docket," said Kara. The deputy director of public prosecutions in KZN, Elaine Zungu, had dealt with the case since its inception. "The State is therefore unable to proceed with the remaining evidence of the witnesses as it requires corroboration," said Kara.
