A police dog with impressive skills recently uncovered 1 000 packets of tik in the Steenberg area and has been commended for his excellent service. Savage, the three-year-old sable German Shepherd, forms part of the City’s metro police K9 unit, and he was honoured on Sunday 7 July for putting in a stellar performance this year. During the last six months, Savage has recovered about R160 000 worth of drugs, which included 85 units of unga, as well as 424 bankies and more than 202g of tik, among others. About a month after receiving his award, on Wednesday 7 August, the well-trained canine and his handler, Constable Mosuli Faku, uncovered the 1 000 packets of tik at an undisclosed location in Steenberg. “The bust took place on Tuesday 6 August. Savage also made a special appearance in the council chamber at the Civic Centre the following day, Wednesday 7 August,” says Richard Bosman, executive director for safety and security. He adds: “The Steenberg bust was the latest success that Savage achieved. We are unable to provide the exact location, as it is subject to an investigation.” According to Sergeant Wesley Twigg, spokesperson for Steenberg police, the value of 1 000 packets of the drug can have an estimated street value between R20 000 and R50 000. In a statement, the metro police department chief, Wayne Le Roux expressed his satisfaction, adding that the unit has been able to build strong community ties to uncover drug dealers and keep up-to-date with the new technologies that criminals use to evade law enforcement and continue their dealings. “We are very proud of the work done by our K9 unit, both during enforcement and also through their education and awareness outreaches. They have helped us develop strong bonds with communities, particularly in teaching children about the role of law enforcement, but they are also a criminal’s worst nightmare. It’s a perfect balance,” Le Roux said.
