There is
bias in both the for and against arguments. The bottom line is that saving
costs through centralised pricing was unachievable to the private sector. They
tried every idea, including standard tariffs and cost saving measures, but
costs continued to spiral, which made it increasingly unaffordable for the
state’s own hospital network but as much so for private medical aid clients. It
was a disaster waiting to happen that would have collapsed the existing system
under the massive weight of runaway costs. As a small,
developing nation we cannot afford such costs, which already “tax us” heavily.
But, as Jan Gerber rightly observes, the fund’s pool will pay private and public
providers, so is likely to see more resources flowing to existing state
hospitals – to address your somewhat unfounded concern about the state of such
institutions – I visit them regularly on business and they are nowhere near as
bad as you make them out to be. What no one
gets is that it will not be the cost behemoth of universal health care. Private
and public sector funding of hospitals and clinics is separate from the NHI,
which is an insurance model that will use a fund to pay existing provider
claims and incentivise them to enhance their practices.     9% of GDP is spent on healthcare in SA, about R450bn, of which R180bn is state
expenditure and R270bn private, but that means private has about seven times the
allocation of total annual health expenditure, per capita. The imbalance is
significant. To bring all uncovered individuals into equitable care, would be
either prohibitive or run the risk of private sector disinvestment until
everyone is equally badly off. That is not the desired outcome, but that is
where the debate should center. The principle of NHI is right, the devil is in
the detail.
