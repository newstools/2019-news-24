This week on POLOTIKI, we ask: Is there a glass ceiling for women in the African National Congress (ANC)? The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal announced that embattled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede and Msunduzi Mayor Themba Njilo would be "redeployed" from their positions. This after the provincial executive committee (PEC) held another special two-day meeting this week. The ANC Women's League has lashed out at the party over a culture of "removing women from positions of power". ANCWL president Bathabile Dlamini called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to "treat everyone equally... male and female".

The debate highlighted that Ramaphosa was not the only one who campaigned, and that the Political Party Funding Act did not extend to internal party leadership campaigns. POLOTIKI takes the conversation further and asks if the president shouldn't open his books to the nation in the interests of the party and his reputation.
