Shots were also fired, but no injuries were reported. Western Cape police spokesperson, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said earlier this week that it was believed that five robbers, two of whom were armed, were involved in the incident at the mall. The two men who were arrested, aged 24 and 28, allegedly changed their names so that the status of a pending robbery case against one was not clear, it emerged. One had previous cases against him. The men face charges of robbery with aggravating circumstances, possession of a firearm and possession of a stolen car. The getaway car was also allegedly reported hijacked in June in Belville south, it emerged. The court heard that when they were arrested they were wearing the same clothing as the people depicted in a CCTV recording of the robbery. In the recording, one man enters the store with what looks like a an item in a large shopping bag and suddenly swings it on to a counter to break the glass. Others enter the store and starts breaking display cabinets and scooping loot into plastic bags. Investigations into the whereabouts of a third person who got away in a car are still under way. Their case has been postponed to September 18. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
