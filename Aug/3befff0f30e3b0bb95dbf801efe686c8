Mpumalanga officials are investigating the cause of a fire which damaged parts of offices at the Acronhoek police station, a spokesperson said on Saturday. The fire started on Friday at 22:20, causing extensive damage to the detectives' offices and the community service centre, police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said. Hlathi said the holding cells were not affected but that those who were in detention were evacuated and moved to other police stations for their own safety. The cause of the fire was unknown. However, the police's forensic department would conduct an investigation, he said. "A comprehensive assessment of the damages will be conducted by experts as it is unsafe for just individuals to enter that part of the building which was damaged." Hlathi said provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma has ensured the establishment of a temporary community service centre. He has also assured surrounding communities that service delivery would not be affected. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
