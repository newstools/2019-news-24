An ANC meeting, held to discuss the removal of Zandile Gumede as mayor and her regional executive committee, has reportedly collapsed after some delegates caused disruptions and overturned tables. A spokesperson in the region was not immediately available to comment, but eNCA and TimesLIVE reported that the meeting, intended to discuss the regional task team's decisions, did not go as planned. eNCA reported that scuffles broke out over credentials and the decision to redeploy officials. According to TimesLIVE, the meeting at Moses Mabhida Stadium was attended by eThekwini branch secretaries, chairpersons and municipal councillors. Delegates milled around the parking lot, with a small police contingent standing by.
