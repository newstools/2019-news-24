Ocean View residents have begun protests in the area, ahead of a supposed "shut down" across Cape Town tomorrow, Thursday 8 August. According to Ocean View police spokesperson Sergeant Leon Fortuin, the protests were said to start at 05:30 on Thursday, but confirms Ocean View residents began protesting today (Wednesday 7 August) just after 18:00. Ocean View community policing forum chairperson Kathy Cronje says the entrance into the area via Kommetjie Road has been blocked off, with the police, law enforcement on the scene. “We advise the road user to temporarily use the alternative routes to Ocean View until it is cleared,” says Cronje. The total shutdown, which has been organised by the "Gatvol Capetonian" group, is a response to the national housing problem by unhappy residents of informal areas, or backyard dwellers, who are looking to the government to hear their cries for "fair housing". City of Cape Town Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith says that while the City supports peaceful protesting, he urged those taking part to "respect the rights of others by not preventing free movement, and to refrain from any damage to refrain from damaging any public or private infrastructure or placing any lives at risk. "We do not believe it is helpful to limit mobility to already vulnerable communities as nothing is achieved by that."
