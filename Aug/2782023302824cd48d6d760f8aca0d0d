Martin Muller (62), a retired farmer from Ermelo in Mpumalanga, is still in a lot of pain after he recently fell two storeys into an empty swimming pool, breaking various bones. One of his sons, Martin (29), says his dad was cleaning solar panels on the roof of his home when the accident happened. “The plank he’d been standing on broke and he fell into the empty cement swimming pool. I heard my nieces and nephews yelling and ran outside,” Martin says. His was conscious but in excruciating pain. Martin Jnr and his elder brother struggled but managed to get their dad out of the pool and into the car. They took him to Mediclinic Ermelo. Martin Snr’s wife, Loretta (54), says her husband broke his left ankle, his left arm was so badly broken the bone poked through the skin, some of his ribs are broken and his pelvic bone is cracked. “I never want to think about that day again. It was horrific. I thought I’d lose him. This big man was crying in pain. But it wasn’t his time,” Loretta told YOU on Monday. “It’s a miracle he survived. We thank the Lord.”  Martin Snr was transferred to the Netcare Linmed Hospital in Benoni, east of Johannesburg, where he’s had two operations so far. “They implanted steel pins in his hand and wanted to fix his ankle too but his blood pressure was too high. They’ll have to try to repair his ankle at a later stage,” Loretta says. The family doesn’t have medical aid and have had to pay for Martin’s treatment in a private hospital out of their own pockets. “Martin and I are staying with family here in Benoni. He’s been discharged from hospital because we’re trying to keep the expenses as low as possible. He’s been in excruciating pain but he’s starting to feel a little better.” Loretta says he’ll return to the Linmed hospital later this month for the ankle operation. A trust has been set up to help pay for Martin’s medical expenses.
