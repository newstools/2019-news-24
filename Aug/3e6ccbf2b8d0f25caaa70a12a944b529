The Hawks' Serious Corruption Investigation team arrested a 43-year-old detective constable stationed at Tzaneen for theft on Wednesday. According to Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke, in March this year, the officer allegedly received R10 000 from the court mediation team that was meant to compensate two victims of assault.

"The Hawks were entrusted with the investigation of the matter and subsequently a warrant of arrest was authorised against the suspect. The suspect is expected to appear at the Tzaneen Magistrate's Court on Friday to face charges relating to theft," Maluleke said.
