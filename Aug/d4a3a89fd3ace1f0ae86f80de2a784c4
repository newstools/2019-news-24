Several people have been arrested for looting and public violence, after Soweto residents targeted foreign-owned shops on Wednesday evening. The spate of violent incidents lasted into the early hours of the morning, police confirmed on Thursday. "Early this morning, we arrested seven [people] for looting and public violence," Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele told News24. Makhubele said an additional two arrests had been made, although they were unrelated to the actual looting. One person was arrested for attempted murder and one for the possession of a stolen motor vehicle. "We are still in Soweto and we are continuing to monitor the situation, however, the situation now is calm, but we will remain until we have restored the law and order," Makhubele said.
