Charles Ntini, 37, who is believed to be a foreign national, was reportedly found dead next to his burning truck on the N2 Main Harding road in Paddock, in the south of the province. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident to Times Live, saying a provincial task team would be investigating.

Today a mother, a wife and kids will not see their son, their husband and their father." The attacks are not new in the province, with assailants alleging that foreign nationals are given jobs as drivers ahead of locals. In June, at least 20 trucks per week were torched in the space of three weeks, News24 reported. High-level meetings between truck owners, drivers and Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula, Minister of Employment and Labour Thulas Nxesi, Minister of Home Affairs Aaron Motsoaledi and Minister of Police Bheki Cele were held in Durban at the beginning of June. Police have since arrested 91 people following the previous attacks.  GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
