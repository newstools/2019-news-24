When Gold Leaf Tobacco Corporation co-owner Simon Rudland approached the offices of the Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association's offices in Norwood on Wednesday morning, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Security camera footage supplied to News24 shows a pedestrian walking past the entrance and scurrying along as Rudland's Porsche turns into the gateway. But seconds later, the morning air and Rudland's car windows are pierced by a volley of bullets, fired by men in a white VW Golf. The shooting lasted roughly four seconds before the gunmen fled. Rudland had a bullet wound to the neck and was rushed to hospital. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
