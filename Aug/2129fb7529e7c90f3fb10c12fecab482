The mayor of Somalia's capital Mogadishu has died of wounds sustained in a militant bombing attack on his office last week, the government said on Thursday. Mayor Abdirahman Omar Osman died while doctors were treating his wounds at a hospital in Doha, a spokesperson for the Somali president's office said. Six people were killed and Osman was initially wounded in the July 24 attack on a government building claimed by Al-Shabaab jihadists to have been targeting a UN envoy.
