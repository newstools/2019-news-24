RELIGIOUS leaders, students, professors and lecturers all came together last Wednesday, August 7 at the Collin Webb Hall, UKZN Pietermaritzburg to partake in the International Silent Protest with the intent on shedding light on gender-based violence in and around campus. Various activities were planned on the day besides the silent protest, such as meditation and yoga spaces as well as arts and crafts for the protestors to engage in as a way for them to vent their frustrations and emotions in a safe way. Protestors spoke of their dismay towards movements such as these and how more needs to be done to highlight the struggles people experience who are going through gender-based violence. “We need to do this more often to show that gender-based violence is not taking a break and neither will we until we eradicate it out of our society,” said a protestor. The Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF), UKZN Gender and Religion Programme, the Umjamaa Centre at UKZN, ACT Ubumbano and We Will Speak Out South Africa all took a stand and participated in the silent protest which stood against the silencing and dehumanising effects of sexual and gender-based violence. All protestors had their mouths taped shut, which they used as a way to represent the hostile and inhuman treatment of SGBV victims and survivors.
