Police are investigating a case of armed robbery after two men robbed customers at gunpoint at a vape store in Bedfordview, east of Johannesburg, on Sunday. The incident was caught on CCTV footage that was shared online. Vaperite store manager Shannon Smith said he was on duty with two other staff members when the men entered the store. "Both were armed. They targeted a gentleman for his Rolex and took his necklace," he told News24 on Wednesday. "Then they moved to his wife who was trying to pay and took her ring and her necklace," Smith added. He said the men then targeted an older woman who was at the counter for her necklace and "left the staff alone". Bedfordview police spokesperson Andre de Jager could not confirm the details of the items stolen, only saying that personal belongings had been taken.
