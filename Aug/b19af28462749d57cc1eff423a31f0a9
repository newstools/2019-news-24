A meeting that was apparently intended to oust Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Mongameli Bobani fell flat on Friday, according to reports. News24 reported the ANC had appeared divided over whether to oust him after some within the party's caucus and smaller parties submitted a petition to speaker Buyelwa Mafaya urging her to hold a special council meeting during recess. However, several coalition government councillors, who had signed the petition, failed to show up at the meeting on Friday and a quorum could not be reached, HeraldLive reported. It said members of the DA, ACDP and Cope who pitched up merely entered the council chambers to observe the rules of order. DA caucus leader Athol Trollip said it was clear some were prepared to pay a price for Bobani's leadership as the deadline for the metro to apply for a rollover of the R500m in unspent funds was at the end of this month, Algoa FM reported. Bobani has survived several attempts to remove him, the most recent in April after the Patriotic Alliance (PA) deserted its motion of no confidence against him. PA councillor Marlon Daniels said in a notice at the time Bobani could not be "trusted" in office. "Councillor Mongameli Bobani has done very little to none for the betterment of the lives of poor communities," he said. Bobani said the PA had used the motion against him as a way of seeking recognition. "I am not even shaken. I am not even worried. As a collective government, we are busy now giving services to our people, so we will hear from the speaker how the motion will be handled," he said in February.
