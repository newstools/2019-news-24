The City of Tshwane is expected to hold a press briefing on Friday to communicate the outcomes of negotiations between South African Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu) who have been striking for a 18% wage increase. Since the start of the week, striking City workers have been blockading streets with buses, refuse trucks and rubbish. They are demanding the same wage increase that was allegedly paid to the City's top managers.
