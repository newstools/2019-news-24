A mother and her son are behind bars after a 50-year-old man was seriously injured in a brick attack in Aliwal North in the Eastern Cape, police have said. The two face a charge of attempted murder, police spokesperson Warrant Officer Moitheri Bojabotseha said in a statement. "This comes after the Aliwal North Hospital notified the police on August 17 when a 50-year-old male victim was transferred back to the hospital from East London. "It is alleged that the victim was struck on the head with a brick on July 20, in Maletswai Block H, Aliwal North. Due to the severity of the injuries he sustained during the attack, he was referred to a hospital in East London. "After [the] victim regained consciousness, he was transported back to the Aliwal North Hospital where the police were able to obtain a statement." Bojabotseha said the pair were in police custody and were expected to appear in court soon. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
