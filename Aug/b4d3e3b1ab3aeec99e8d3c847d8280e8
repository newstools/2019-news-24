A video of a dog refusing to walk
with its owner has warmed the hearts of people around the world after being
shared on Twitter. American Steph Haberman couldn’t
resist capturing the hilarious moment when a dog lying on her back with her
paws in the air on a pavement in New York City refuses to get up while her
owner unsuccessfully tries to continue their stroll, Daily Mail reports. “Not EVERYTHING is bad. Like this dog I met
yesterday who did NOT want to walk anymore. She’s good!” she captioned the
video which has received more than three million views. The owner can be
seen pleading with the dog, even shaking her paws in an effort to get her
moving, New Zealand Herald reports. Steph shared the
video on Sunday in the wake of the two mass shootings that took place in Texas
and Ohio in the hopes that it would lift the grim mood that had settled on the
country. After the
overwhelmingly positive response to the video, Steph took to Twitter again,
saying, "Saturday was a terrible day. Sunday was a terrible day. But on
Saturday I took a video of a funny dog and on Sunday I decided to share it.  “That dog video now
has over a million views, which means on these terrible days I got to make a million
people smile." Other Twitter users
also took to the platform to post videos and photos of their own dogs doing
something similar. “Lando flops down outside of doggie
daycare when I pick him up,” one person said of the pic they shared. “While I
embarrassedly say, ‘C'mon, buddy, let's go home. Look at all your friends
getting into their owners’ cars . . .”  Another posted a snapshot of her dog
lying down on a mountain trail while they were out foraging for
mushrooms. Yet another commiserated with the
woman and her dog, sharing a pic of her pooch on his back on the grass, saying,
“Jasper feels the same way.” Sources: Daily Mail, New Zealand Herald
