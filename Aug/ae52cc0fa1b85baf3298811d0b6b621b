WATCH | Compromised? Questions over handling of wreckage after Gavin Watson crash Questions have been raised about the handling of the wreckage of the car Gavin Watson died in on Monday. "What had been done is that either last weekâ€¦ or [the] week before that, I had signed what we call a Regulation 10 (6) directive and that is the directive that the chairperson is empowered in terms of the regulations to issue to a person that may have information that is relevant to the terms of reference of the commission," Zondo said. Zondo said the directive he signed did not require Watson to appear before the commission but rather to furnish an affidavit dealing with various matters that had been raised in the statement of former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi. During his testimony before the Zondo commission, Agrizzi delivered bombshell testimony of alleged illegality, including corrupt tenders, bribes and claims that Bosasa bribed its way out of trouble after it was in hot water with the National Prosecuting Authority. He also told Zondo that Watson paid senior staff cash on a monthly basis, and allegedly instructed his close associates to structure deals to hide the truth from the SA Revenue Service (SARS). Agrizzi described the payments as an incentive for staff members to keep quiet about alleged bribery practices that continued for years. He estimated that tens of millions of rand were paid in bribes to, mainly, Department of Correctional Services and Department of Social Development officials in exchange for lucrative multibillion-rand tenders, News24 earlier reported.
