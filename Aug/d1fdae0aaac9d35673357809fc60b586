THE newly installed closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in St Francis Bay, have within months led to a reduction in crime in the area. According to the local security companies and St Francis Bay Police Station, the CCTV monitoring system - installed by the St Francis Pro-perty Owners Association (SFPO) and funded through the Special Ra-ting Area ((SRA) levy - played an important role in reducing crime to the lowest levels in a long time. A total of 100 cameras were installed at key entry and exit points to St Francis Bay, as well as along arterial roads and pedestrian routes, key bridges and intersections. The cameras are linked to a state-of-the-art 24/7 monitoring centre run by Atlas Security. “The CCTV monitoring system provides the police and security companies with the means of timeously responding to incidences, and possibly preventing crimes from taking place,” says St Francis Property Owners Chairman, Wayne Furphy. “In addition, CCTV recordings can be used as admissible evidence to secure convictions of criminals.” Police have been able to make use of footage to effect several arrests. The suspect who attempted to vandalise one of the cameras at the Main Beach, appeared in court and was given community service after an official apology was received. In the case of a fatal hit-and-run in Sea Vista, the driver was identified and apprehended. The camera coverage on the Sea Vista Pathway, once it is upgraded, will provide additional security be-nefits to pedestrians.
