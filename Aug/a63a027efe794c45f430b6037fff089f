 Bishop Lavis High School creative arts teacher Florance Vermeulen is encouraging his students to dance their way to success. In a video going viral online, the dynamic Cape Town educator can be seen leading his class in a synchronised dance to Afrobeats hit 'Azonto' by Ghanaian-British hitmaker Fuse ODG. "I didn’t post the video for entertainment sake, that was not my intention," teacher Florance Vermeulen told News24. "It was just to inspire the class and make people aware that there is more than just violence and negativity to our community."

Vermeulen is committed to creating a positive impact on his students’ lives through the creative arts. "Whatever I do in my work, it must always have some sort of aspect where kids can way away with something valuable, something that they can implement in their lives daily," he said.
