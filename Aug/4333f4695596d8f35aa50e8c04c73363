A 27-year-old man will appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court today (Thursday 8 August) after police charged him with the murder of 30-year-old Meghan Cremer. According to Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk, police found Cremer's body in Philippi in the early hours of Thursday morning. Cremer, an avid horse rider who lived on a farm in the area, was reported missing on Saturday 3 August and seen wearing a green top and a pair of black tracksuit pants and driving a white Toyota Auris at the time of her disappearance. "On the same evening at about 20:00 police arrested three men aged 27, 34 and 35 for the illegal possession of presumably stolen motor vehicle. Investigation brought to light that the car belonged to Cremer reported as missing to local police," says Van Wyk. The three men, which includes the murder suspect, were charged with illegal possession of a presumably stolen vehicle and are all due to appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court today (Thursday 8 August). "Our investigation and search operation led us to a sand mine on a Philippi farm this morning at around 01:00 where the body of the missing person was found," Van Wyk confirms.
