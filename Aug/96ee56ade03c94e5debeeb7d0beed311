Police have released a statement saying they are on the hunt for two men, believed to have been calming bees with smoke when the fire broke out. The fire caused damage to 13 homes. Two helicopters and 85 firefighters battled the blaze at Lyme Road North, and assistance was requested from the Sarah Baartman District Municipality and Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. “On Thursday around 13:00, a woman alleged that she saw two men with a beehive in the open field, behind Lyme Road North, St Francis Bay,” said police spokesperson Sergeant Majola Nkohli.
