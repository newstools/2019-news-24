Police in Fairland, Johannesburg, are urging motorists to be vigilant when using car remotes to lock their vehicles. This comes after an unsuspecting woman became a victim of remote jamming at an Engen garage off Beyers Naudé Drive in Johannesburg on Thursday. "There is a huge problem regarding car jamming, especially in the area of Fairland," the area's police spokesperson Constable Moloko Kgatla told News24. The victim had made a stop at the garage to buy something at the convenience store. Instead of locking her car manually, she used her remote. Unbeknown to her, a criminal sitting in a car parked next to her had jammed the signal, preventing it from locking. The man then opened the back door of the car and took a bag from her back seat. The bag contained a few items of clothing. "She came to the police station to open a case of theft," Kgatla said. He said police were investigating the matter. They were able to get the registration number of the vehicle used by the thief for his getaway, but have not tracked down the remote jammer yet.
