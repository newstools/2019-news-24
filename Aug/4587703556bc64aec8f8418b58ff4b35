Mitchells Plain in Cape Town will play host to the Cape Flats Book Festival, which runs from August 31 to September 1. Described as "a first" for the region by literacy non-profit organisation Read to Rise, the festival will showcase local authors, illustrators, literacy NGOs, specialists, publishers and booksellers. There will be book readings, talks, workshops and a puppet show for children and adults alike. "The Book Festival hopes to create excitement on the Cape Flats about reading through positive engagement with books. The festival will be held over the weekend leading up to National Book Week from September 2 to 8," Read to Rise said in a statement. Athol Williams, Read to Rise's chairperson, said: "Establishing the Cape Flats Book Festival is an act of hope. It is like planting a tree in a desert. From the outside, this may look like a pointless endeavour because trees don't grow in a desert, but those who look to the Cape Flats in hope know that this is not a desert, that there are hidden lakes and gushing rivers that may not be seen but are there nonetheless."
