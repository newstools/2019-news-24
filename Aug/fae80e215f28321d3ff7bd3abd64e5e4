Two men accused of attacking and robbing an American investor last month briefly appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday where the case was postponed for a bail application. Mathew Chabaku, 50, and Monde Mphoso, 42, allegedly attacked Thomas Mobille, who had been exploring the Johannesburg CBD in June. Bricks were used to bludgeon him over the head, and he was robbed of his wallet and cellphone before he was left for dead on the corner of Commissioner and Polly streets in the Johannesburg city centre. He spent more than a month in a coma at Milpark Hospital in northern Johannesburg. News24 has since learnt that Mobille is no longer in a coma and is undergoing rehabilitation at the private hospital. Mobille, who is a partner at Limiar Capital Management, had travelled to South Africa to meet with the management of listed companies about investing in the country. His company invests in global emerging markets.

One of Mobille's partners in the US contacted local businessman Jared Coetzer about the attack, News24 earlier reported. Coetzer said Mobille's wife Marta, brother John, and business colleague Carlos, arrived in the country a few days after the incident. The bail application is scheduled for August 7.
