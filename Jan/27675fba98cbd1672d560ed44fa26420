"The French interpreter is off sick," said Magistrate Gregory Jacobs. Mitspa Onyoka arrived in the dock from the cells, wearing sandals, tracksuit pants and a hoodie. He tugged at his beard stubble and the toggles on his tracksuit top as prosecutor Melaney Wells broke the news about the lack of an interpreter to the magistrate. Curran was found stabbed to death in a secure high-end building opposite the provincial offices of the National Prosecuting Authority in Cape Town.
