The duo allegedly found a way to "manipulate" the system to register ineligible students, said Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi. "The pair allegedly demanded hefty amounts from applicants who did not meet the set admission criteria by manipulating the system and awarding more points for entrance to the university," he said. Mulaudzi said their arrest followed an intelligence-driven operation conducted by the Hawks' serious commercial crime investigating unit and Crime Intelligence at the university's Braamfontein campus. Both suspects were arrested at the campus, he said. The administration officer and the student are expected to appear in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Thursday to face charges of fraud and corruption, said Mulaudzi. Investigations are continuing, he added.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
