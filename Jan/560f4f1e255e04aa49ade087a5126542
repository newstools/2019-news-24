He appeared briefly in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday afternoon. The case was postponed to January 15. The artist, whose real name is Thulani Ngcobo, told the court he could not afford to pay for a lawyer and he would apply for legal aid. Ngcobo was arrested on Tuesday after a pathologist who examined Modusane's body found that she could have died from injuries she had sustained, the police's Lungelo Dlamini told News24 on Wednesday. Dlamini said Modusane was found in a room at a bed and breakfast in Bellevue, Johannesburg, with injuries to her upper body.
