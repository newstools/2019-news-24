Mavimbela said the baby was rescued and is recovering inside an incubator at a local hospital. "Anyone who could possibly know the whereabouts of Lebogang Botolo may contact Warrant Officer Gerard Henning of the SAPS Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit on 071 675 7489 or contact the nearest police station," he said.
