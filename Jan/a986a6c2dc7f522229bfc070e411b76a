The man was found by security at the substation where he was electrocuted. It’s believed the man allegedly entered the substation by breaking the padlock that secures the enclosure. The alleged suspect was found in the possession of working tools, according to police reports. Speaking to DRUM, spokesperson for City Power Isaac Mangena said this is an incident they are familiar with and they warn citizens against it. “This is a problem we face at our substations – people breaking the locks we use to secure the stations, so they can do criminal activities. The locks to the station where this man was found electrocuted were broken similar to the incident that happened in Newclare, Randburg two weeks ago where the suspect gained entry into the substation and then got electrocuted.” “We can confirm that we are investigating a case of inquest following the death of an unknown man.The deceased was wearing navy-blue sneakers, purple tracksuit and a brown jacket.The deceased was declared dead on the scene by paramedics. He looks to be in his late 20s or early 30s. If anybody is missing their next [of] kin with the following description, they can contact SAPS Moffat View on 011-405-1500. Warrant Officer Esrom Mdlalose is the investigating officer,” Captain Jeff Phora of the Moffat View Police Station said in a statement. City Power is again warning people against trying to vandalise and dismantle their infrastructure as this is not only costly to the City, but often leads to death or injury.       24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
