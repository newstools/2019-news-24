seven people in Vlakfontein, south of Johannesburg, last year, has committed
suicide, police confirmed on Thursday morning. Mabaso, 27, and Fita Khupe, 61, are accused of murdering
seven members of the Khoza family in October. The police found the bodies of three women and four children
buried under sand in a house in Vlakfontein on October 29 after neighbours
noticed a stench coming from the house. Mabaso was also facing three counts of rape. The case against the men was due to sit in the Protea
Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Mabaso died on Friday, police spokesperson Kay Makhubele
told News24 on Thursday. Makhubele said the suspect was booked out of prison by
police officers for "further investigations" and died while in
holding cells at Cape Town Central Police Station. Makhubele could not immediately say why Mabaso was taken to
Cape Town for "further investigations" and what the details of those
investigations were. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
