These criminals have been for quite some time instilling fear into shoppers in Sandton and surrounding areas," Nkosi-Malobane said on Wednesday. She said the men were caught with two unlicenced firearms and ammunition with the serial numbers filed off, a 9mm pistol with 13 rounds, a sub-machine gun with 21 rounds, a sachet of cocaine, two Okapi knives, two balaclavas and two pairs of hand gloves. "I am confident that, with the evidence at police’s disposal, they will be able to present a watertight case to ensure that these suspects receive the highest possible terms behind bars. This will send a strong message that Gauteng has zero tolerance against any act of criminality," she said.
