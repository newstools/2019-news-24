Styan said the N2 between Peregrine and Houwhoek hotel was closed due to smoke coming from the Houwhoek pass. The R321 road is also closed. "The most intense activity is in the area between Houwhoek (the hotel and guest houses are safe and not threatened) and Cherry Clamping. Difficult conditions and majority of resources deployed here," FPA said on Facebook.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
