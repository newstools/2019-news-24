The party's secretary general Ace Magashule told reporters at a press conference on Friday that Mbeki had apologised for not being part of the launch. "We have invited all former leaders of the ANC, including former NEC (national executive committee) members, who are still alive. Mbeki indicated he would have loved to come but has other engagements. He has apologised for not coming," said Magashule. When pressed for an answer on whether there were other factors that might have led to Mbeki's decision to miss such an important event, Magashule said: "I can't speak on behalf of Mbeki. It's not only him. There are many other NEC members who will not be there tomorrow (Saturday)." WATCH: 'We are united' - ANC leaders as it marks 107 years The ANC spent a better part of its 107th year anniversary insisting that it was a united party and that there was no tension between its current president Cyril Ramaphosa and his predecessor Jacob Zuma. Magashule confirmed that former president Jacob Zuma would be part of the event. 'Divisive' messages not allowed The party said T-shirts and placards with "divisive" messages would not be allowed inside Moses Mabhida Stadium where the manifesto launch is taking place. Alcohol and firearms would also not be allowed inside the stadium, the party said. T-shirts with faces of former presidents, however, would be allowed. Magashule reiterated that the party was united ahead of the event, especially in KwaZulu-Natal.

He said it did not mean that there was disunity in the party "when there are a few voices [complaining]". Court challenges shot down With regards to outstanding regional conferences, such as the one in the Moses Mabhida region in KwaZulu-Natal, Magashule said the party would consult its members. The region reportedly took the ANC to court on Friday morning demanding that its conference be held before the elections. "It's not only Moses Mabhida that has not held its conference. All those regions were told now the focus is on the elections. We will deal with that matter afterwards." Magashule said the ANC would act against party members who continued to take the party to court when they had "exhausted" all internal processes of the party. Magashule said the party's manifesto was a "people's manifesto". "It captures the hopes of the people of country," he said. Delegations from other countries expected The former Free State premier acknowledged that more work still needed to be done "despite the work that the ANC has done since 1994". He said the ANC's manifesto would encompass issues including crime, unemployment, poverty and corruption. "We commit ourselves that the manifesto will speak to the tangible change that our people want to see," he said ALSO READ: ANC would be 'limping today' if it did not merge factions in Nasrec - Mabuza Delegations from political parties from other countries would also be part of the launch, the party said.
