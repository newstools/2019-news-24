The man was discovered in excruciating pain by a passerby, who then alerted officials. Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said that the victim, who suffered multiple stab wounds, remained in a critical condition in hospital.

"Preliminary investigations led the police to the suspect’s house within the village, where the alleged severed private parts were found placed in a washing basket, and forensics will determine if indeed the parts found do belong to the victim," said Ngoepe. Selomane, who is also a convicted murderer, remains behind bars until his next court appearance. "The motive for this brutal attack is unknown at this stage, but police investigations are continuing," Ngoepe said.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
