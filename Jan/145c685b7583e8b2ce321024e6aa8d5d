Rochelle Pryor from Perth, Australia, sent a message on social media to several of her friends just hours before her father found her unconscious in her bedroom on New Year’s Day, Daily Mail reports. "Once I'm gone, the bullying and the racism will stop," Rochelle wrote on Facebook. The teenager died in hospital nine days later on 10 January, News.com reports. She was reportedly involved in an altercation outside her school gates at Fremantle College last year. In a recent media interview the girl’s mom, Wendy Paterson, said her daughter had come home with severe cuts on her legs. "After that happened she was upset and scared and said she didn’t want to go to school anymore," Wendy said. "She really went downhill." Her older sister, Kyanne Pryor (17), described Rochelle as "sweet, happy and funny" but said her friends reportedly turned against her, Mirror reports. "She was really upset by it," Kyanne said. "There was racism involved – a lot of the time it was just random people who don't realise what they're saying." Rochelle's friends have since paid tribute to her. "My vision is so blurry from my tears . . .  come back please," a student wrote on Instagram. "The last day we were talking about what colour you should dye your hair and you were thinking about . . . blue or purple.  "If I knew that was your last day, I would do anything to stop you. "I remember telling you whenever you weren't in the right mindset I would repeat telling you 'I'm always here for you'."
