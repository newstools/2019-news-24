The radio station reported that light overnight winds gave firefighters the upper hand in battling the blaze, but officials were closely monitoring the situation. "The wind has dropped considerably making fighting the fire much easier. The fire is currently under control. There are two helicopters still water bombing the Glen side of Lions Head. There were no injuries of any firefighters, however a person who appears to have been sleeping on the mountain sustain 45% burns," Cape Town Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said."No property was damaged and no evacuations were undertaken. It does appear that a private security company may have encouraged some residents to evacuate but it was not on the request of the City and the evacuation was premature and not required."
