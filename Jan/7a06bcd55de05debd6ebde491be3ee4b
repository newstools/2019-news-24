"There was an arrangement with her parents that she will go home with the teacher after the crèche closed and wait at the home for the parents to fetch her. Everybody was stunned by the sudden attack, as it was not the first time the child stayed over at the teacher's house.” The child's parents also stay in Sederberg Street. The White River SPCA confiscated the two dogs and later put them down.
