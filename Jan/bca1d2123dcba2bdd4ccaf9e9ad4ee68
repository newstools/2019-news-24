of suspected stolen copper cables on Monday. He was detained together with an
alleged accomplice. Police
spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini, said the two were nabbed after local security
officers received information about copper cables being kept at a farm house. Both
of them are expected to appear in court on Wednesday. "Police officers involved in
criminal activities are acting against the South African Police Service code
of conduct and are a burden to management," Dlamini said "An
internal investigation to determine the fitness of the sergeant to remain
in the [police] service has been initiated, following his arrest," Dlamini
added. He said a thorough internal
investigation would be conducted and, if the sergeant was found guilty of a
misconduct, his services would be terminated.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
