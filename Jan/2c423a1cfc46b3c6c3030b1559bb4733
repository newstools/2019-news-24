More than 600 commuters were injured when two trains collided near Pretoria's Mountain View train station on Tuesday. Nzimande said that Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) management should account for the incident.

Reports suggest that the two trains were both travelling on the same line towards Pretoria from Mabopane when they collided. The minister said preliminary investigations had revealed that cable theft was to blame for the accident. He wants a full brief on the role of security companies who were meant to be guarding the railways. "These companies take hundreds of millions of rands, but we do not see any difference. "I have said to the chairperson of the board that I want answers within the next few days as to what action is taken to address the security issue," said Nzimande.

The minister endured the rain at the crash scene as he examined the wreckage first-hand and was briefed by engineers on site about what had led to the trains colliding. "We need a strategy, but at the same time we need accountability from management, because families may have lost breadwinners from this fatal crash." Nzimande has called on the Railway Safety Regulator of South Africa (RSR) to go "deeper in its investigations". He also challenged his department to look into rail safety in the country. #TrainCrash Transport Minister Blade Nzimande visited the crash scene and promises that there will be accountability. He has also questioned the role of commissioned security companies who guard the railways. @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/g5MLgiUjis  In October, the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria issued a supervisory order instructing Prasa to comply with the safety requirements set out by the RSR. Subsequently, the regulatory body made known its intention to revoke Prasa's safety permit after two trains collided on October 4 near Van Riebeeck station in Kempton Park during manual authorisation. Prasa took to the courts in an effort to keep operating, despite safety concerns, and the RSR eventually rescinded its decision to suspend, seemingly so that millions of commuters across the country would not be inconvenienced. However, the United National Transport Union (Untu) has not spared Nzimande from blame, saying both the minister and Prasa must be held accountable.

Nzimande has now instructed Prasa to ensure that its automated signalling system is fully installed urgently, while it also considers ways to ensure that cables, among other equipment, are secured. Prasa board chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama said that some stations were closed off during the December holidays, with officials installing the automated signalling system, and assured that 90% of the project had already been completed. "If we can fix all these other side issues (theft), we should be able to properly roll out the authorisation system," Kweyama said. She said that the board had also committed to the rail regulator that the system would be implemented soon.
