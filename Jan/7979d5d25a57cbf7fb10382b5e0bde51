Sesona Ngqakamba The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will consult its lawyers following what it calls an "infringement" by the African National Congress (ANC) for using the slogan "One South Africa for all" during its 107th birthday celebrations. The party alleges that the ANC had "stolen" its election slogan, which the Mmusi Maimane-led organisation launched in April 2018. DA national spokesperson Solly Malatsi said the party had chosen the slogan because they were "the only party that is still committed to achieving non-racial ideals in South Africa". "We have committed ourselves to effective redress, growing the economy in order to create jobs, creating safe communities and ensuring stringent property rights," Malatsi said in a statement. WATCH: 'We are united' - ANC leaders as it marks 107 years The ANC spent a better part of its 107th year anniversary insisting that it was a united party and that there was no tension between its current president Cyril Ramaphosa and his predecessor Jacob Zuma. He added that the ANC was, however, the "antithesis" of the very values. Malatsi said the party would consult its lawyers in order to ascertain what their recourse could be. However, ANC national acting spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the DA was "insignificant" at this stage, as the governing party was focusing on its upcoming manifesto launch.  Finally, the ANC agrees that it's time to build #OneSAforAll.While you have just come to the realisation, we have been working to spread this message of hope. pic.twitter.com/2jwRTiWqC4  Ahead of the 2019 national election, the ANC will hold its official manifesto launch on Saturday at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. "[The] Democratic Alliance is so insignificant for us to be talking about at this stage. They have got enough problems internally. What they call they are 'consulting about' is a deflection for us," Kodwa said. He added that the DA was trying to pull a "publicity stunt" by claiming the party had "stolen" the slogan. "We are focusing on our manifesto because DA as a political party is insignificant and the DA is no longer an important player in South African politics, but thirdly the ANC is the only non-racial political party," Kodwa said.
