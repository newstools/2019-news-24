"We received an anonymous tip-off that there was a dog neglected and abused and living in a small closed box," the Kleinmond Animal Welfare Society (KAWS) said. "Our fieldworker went to investigate and found the dog in the worst possible state," KAWS chairperson Tracey Cohen told News24 on Friday. The dog named Bambi was immediately taken to the vet and it was found that he was "gravely ill from abuse". The owner then approached the welfare group, demanding that his pet be returned. "We declined, and I went to the police station to lay charges. After much run around, it was impossible to lay charges," she explained. Law enforcement finally acted when the animal welfare group enlisted the help of a lawyer. "We then got an animal rights lawyer involved, Ryno Engelbrecht, who did all our legal work and the charges were then laid. "Law enforcement had given him (owner) a fine of R500, which he paid, and he wanted his dog back,” she said. Cohen said that is was "heartwarming" how "everyone has come together for justice for Bambi". "It is so hard to get a successful prosecution for our voiceless animals and I think the animal loving community has had enough," she said.
