In national and provincial elections, voters vote for a political party, not individuals. 3. Political parties get a share of seats in Parliament in direct proportion to the number of votes they got in the election. 4. Each party then decides on members to fill the seats it has won. This is called a proportional representation voting system. 5. South Africa’s electoral system has been a proportional representation system since 1994. 6. 22 932 voting stations will open from 8am to 5pm on Saturday 26 January and Sunday 27 January 2019 to allow first-time voters to register. 7. There are 26.1 million registered voters on the voters’ roll, but there are still at least another 9 million South Africans who are old enough to vote, but haven’t registered. 8. The lowest voter registration levels are for voters aged 18 – 19 (15.6% of estimated eligible population) and 20 – 29 (56.7% of estimated eligible population). That’s you! 9. All South Africa citizens aged 16 and older with an ID can register to vote – although only those who are at least 18 on voting day may vote. 10. South Africans living abroad can also vote in the 2019 national elections. They can register to vote at any of South Africa’s 120 missions worldwide from 1-4 February 2019.
