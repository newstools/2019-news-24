She disappeared on January 25 and since then, there has been no sight of the partially paralysed and mentally disabled girl. The Pink Ladies organisation, which helps find missing children, indicated in a flyer that Jeneva may have left her 4-year-old cousin, who she had been playing with, to run in the direction of her mother and aunt as they were on their way to the shop. She disappeared afterwards. She was last seen wearing a pink Barbie top with black leggings and she was barefoot. "If you know the whereabouts of eight-year-old Jeneva Diergal of Klawer, kindly contact Captain Leon Matthys of Vredendal FCS on 082 334 8862, as she is being sought," spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut urged.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
