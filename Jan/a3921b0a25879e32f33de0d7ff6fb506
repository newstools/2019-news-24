The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said the Plettenberg Bay pilot and his wife were found safe at the beach. "The pilot had landed on the beach in an emergency landing during a flight from Port Elizabeth to George following suspected motor failure," said the NSRI's Paul van Jaarsveld. Van Jaarsveld added that the crew joined the police, Kouga Fire and Rescue Services and the Eastern Cape government's Emergency Services personnel who had already been activated by the Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre. Van Jaarsveld said the incident was being investigated by the Civil Aviation Authority.
