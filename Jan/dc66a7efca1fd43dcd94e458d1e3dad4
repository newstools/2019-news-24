Authorities say a Connecticut woman has died at a hospital after falling down stairs at a Manhattan subway station while holding her 1-year-old daughter in a stroller. The medical examiner will determine what caused the death of 22-year-old Malaysia Goodson of Stamford, Connecticut. The New York Post says Goodson's child was not hurt. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which also is investigating, calls Goodson's death "a heartbreaking tragedy". The incident occurred at around 20:00 on Monday at the Seventh Avenue B-D-E station in midtown Manhattan.
