Forty-year-old lvone Mushwana, who was a teacher at a school in Ntsako Village, was with her boyfriend next to a local scrapyard when people nearby heard gunshots. "They (the people) immediately went to investigate and they found the woman lying dead on the ground... and that the boyfriend ran away and disappeared," said police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. "Within a few hours of hunting, the boyfriend, Khashane Willy Malatji, aged 45, who is a local businessman, was found dead in his house at Nkowankowa in the Ritavi policing area outside Tzaneen with a gunshot wound and the firearm lying next to his body," Ngoepe added. Domestic violence Ngoepe said a case of murder was being investigated and that there would be an inquest into the man's death. "The motive behind this incident is still not clear at this stage but domestic violence may not be ruled out," Ngoepe continued. There has been a spate of domestic violence-related killings in the province. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has urged people who have domestic problems to "consult their local professionals to provide the appropriate intervention rather than resorting to violence or harming each other".
