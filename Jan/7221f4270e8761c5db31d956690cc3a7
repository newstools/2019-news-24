Areas affected by the storm include: "The City is prioritising area outages first, after which individually reported power supply complaints will be attended to," said City spokesperson Lindela Mashigo. "The wet weather conditions made it difficult to restore power in some of the zones on Tuesday night, but we remain committed to ensuring that all our consumers receive power supply as soon as possible," Mashigo added. Mashigo urged residents to be patient as technicians do their work and while fallen trees are removed from roads.
