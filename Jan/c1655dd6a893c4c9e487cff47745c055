Nsuku Mhlongo died when he fell and his body was reportedly retrieved on Saturday. Khato Holdings group CEO Mongezi Mnyani said in a statement on Monday that Mhlongo's death was "tragic and regrettable". The company dispatched its own team to investigate the incident, Mnyani said. "Our team is also working round the clock in conjunction with Mopani District Municipality to find out what happened and prevent a recurrence of [a] similar incident in future. We are equally inquiring to find out the truth because we pulled out of site in September due to non-payment by the employer. Therefore, for four months to date, there has been no activities on site and no maintenance and safeguarding of the pipelines. It would be "readily available" and would fully co-operate with authorities during the probe, Myani said. According to EWN, the project, worth billions, was intended to supply water to Giyani and surrounding villages. It was abandoned after the Department of Water and Sanitation allegedly failed to pay the contractor. "What we want to see at the end of the day is for that project to be completed and be handed over to us so that we can start supply water to our communities," Mopani Municipality's spokesperson, Witness Tiva, told the radio broadcaster.
