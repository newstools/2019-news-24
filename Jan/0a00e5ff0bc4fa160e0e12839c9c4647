The Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation unit arrested the 47-year-old woman on Tuesday. "The consultant ... allegedly invaded a client's bank account early this month and fraudulently transferred sums of money into different fictitious accounts, where her fellow syndicate members would then allegedly make withdrawals", Hawks spokesperson Matimba Maluleke alleged. "The Hawks' investigation thus far has uncovered that the consultant allegedly authorised replicated bank cards with a valid PIN code on the victim's account to enable the looting to appear as if it was the client's transactions," Maluleke added. Maluleke said the woman was likely to face charges of fraud‚ money laundering and contraventions of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act. He said additional arrests could not be ruled out as the investigations continue.
