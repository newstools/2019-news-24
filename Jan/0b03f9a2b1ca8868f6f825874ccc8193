“School burglary and vandalism is a not a fight we can tackle alone,” says provincial minister of education Debbie Schäfer. Despite increased security measures at schools across the province during the December holiday period, Schäfer says perpetrators continue to target schools. A total of 27 burglary and vandalism incidents were reported by various schools across the province over the December holiday period. During the same period last year, 33 incidents were reported. “None of the incidents are classified as major, but some incidents are costing the department over R50 000,” she says. She adds that an incident is classified as minor if the estimated cost of repairs is below R100 000 and the school’s ability to function is not impacted in any way. She added that perpetrators also targeted a feeding scheme kitchen. They stole over 100kg of food including rice, maize meal, beans and soya. “They also stole copper taps and storage containers. It is simply deplorable to steal food out of the mouths of our learners. It is also completely irresponsible to damage water infrastructure, given the drought we have been through over the last few years,” she says. In another incident in the Metro Central school, perpetrators gained access via the roof, damaging the roof and the ceiling. “The perpetrators ripped out wiring, damaging the school intercom system, and stole ICT equipment from the admin block,” says Schäfer. She added that reported “minor” incidents included theft of copper pipes, electrical cabling, computer equipment and school stationery. “In some incidents, perpetrators targeted schools simply to destroy property and left without stealing anything. This blatant destruction is unacceptable,” says Schäfer. Schäfer says while they can and do try to safeguard schools with additional security measures, they cannot win the fight against school burglary and vandalism without community support as schools, given their extensive physical infrastructure, are very difficult areas to secure. “A school is a community asset. Tackling the scourge of burglary and vandalism at Western Cape schools is not a fight that we can tackle alone. Everyone should help protect schools as it is fundamental to the future of our children. Our Safe Schools Directorate is very active in mobilising communities to look after schools, in conjunction with the police and community-based organisations. The cooperation of the community and the police is essential in order to combat vandalism and to create a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning. “I am urging community members to please be extra vigilant throughout the year and to immediately report any suspicious behaviour or activities that occur within the vicinity of their schools.” School burglary and vandalism is a not a fight we can tackle alone, says provincial minister of education Debbie Schäfer.

She adds that an incident is classified as minor if the estimated cost of repairs is below R100 000 and the school’s ability to function is not impacted in any way. “At a Cape Winelands school, perpetrators stole 9metres of fencing,” she says. “How are we supposed to protect our learners from outside elements when school fences are being carried away bit by bit? I am especially calling on communities to report any suspicious behaviour around our schools – it is impossible that the perpetrators can remove 9m of fencing without being seen.” She went on to say that at a Metro Central school, perpetrators targeted a feeding scheme kitchen They stole over 100kg of food including rice, maize meal, beans and soya. “They also stole copper taps and storage containers.
