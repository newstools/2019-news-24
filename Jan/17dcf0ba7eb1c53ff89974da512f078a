"It is alleged that, on Tuesday at about 05:00, at the Engen 1-Stop garage next to N1 South, a Toyota Quantum towing a trailer was parked at this garage after it experienced mechanical problems," Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said in a statement on Tuesday. The six armed suspects approached the vehicle, opened the doors and robbed the driver and the passengers of money and cellphones. The men then attempted to get away in the vehicle, but fled after they could not start it. "There were no injuries or fatalities during this ordeal. The suspects involved in this matter are still unknown and there is no arrest," Ngoepe added. Police have opened a case of armed robbery for further investigations and have called on anyone with information to come forward.
