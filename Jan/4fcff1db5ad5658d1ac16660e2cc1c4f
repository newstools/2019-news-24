The suspect subjected the family to threats via WhatsApp and demanded a sum of R30 000. "The perpetrator also mentioned the fact that he knew that the man was a wealthy person. The perpetrator demanded that unless he is paid an amount of R30 000 he would do something drastic to the man and his family," Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said in a statement on Tuesday. The Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department SWAT unit received information at approximately 14:00 that the money that had been demanded would be delivered to a location at Eastgate Mall. "The suspect was pounced upon when he picked up the bag of cash and arrested. "The cash was recovered, and a cellphone found on the suspect reflected the threatening messages he had been communicating to the victim," Kgasago added. The suspect who is known to the family claimed that he was not a criminal and that he merely acted out of desperation as he was in dire need of cash. The man will appear in the Germiston Magistrate's Court soon to face charges of extortion.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
