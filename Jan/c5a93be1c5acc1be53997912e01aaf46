The three accused - Creshion Dreyer, 19, Chermandrie Dreyer, 25, and 26-year-old Diketso Mabula - appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. They are accused of stabbing to death 22-year-old Patrick Kagiso in Phase 4, Bloemside on Sunday. "The incident follows a scuffle that ensued over the deceased leaving the BTK gang to join the Roma gang," police spokesperson Thandi Mbambo said. Mbambo added that the brothers were arrested on the scene with the assistance of the community. Public Order Police arrested their co-accused after following at his parents' home. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Moeketsi Sempe commented: "The community taking a stance against gang terrors is much appreciated and it is the only way we can ultimately protect our children against the influence of these gangs." The men's bail application was postponed to February 5.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
