A case of murder is being investigated by KwaZulu-Natal police following a fatal stabbing of a foreign shop owner at the weekend, police said on Tuesday. Disturbing CCTV footage of the incident has been circulating on social networks since Sunday. The video shows the shop owner and a group of men on the other side of his counter seemingly arguing in Imbali Unit 1, Pietermaritzburg. There are steel bars separating the shop owner from the group. During the argument, one of the men grabs the shop owner by his shirt and seconds later stabs him on his upper body. The store owner than holds his chest while the perpatrators run away. Seconds later, he collapses. He later died at a local clinic, police said. According to Sayed Khokon, who posted the video on eThekwini Secure's Facebook page on Sunday evening, the deceased was from Bangladesh. Khokon wrote that the deceased was his brother. He ruled out robbery as a motive for the murder. Replying to comments on his post, Khokon wrote: "Lindokuhle Nkwanyana they kill my brother just for nothing. They come to buy something and they says is too much expensive, while they are bargaining look what they have done. Is all about South African law of government and administration (sic)." "We know we will never get justice but allah will see them. Every day in South Africa our Bangladeshi people are dying by some of African people but the government and administration just quit about this (sic)," Khokon claimed. The video was also shared by @crimeairnetwork on Twitter. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder is being investigated by Plessislaer police.
