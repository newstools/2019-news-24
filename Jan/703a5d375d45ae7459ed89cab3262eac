Today I was pushed off my bi-cycle by a Gautrain bus driver, bald guy with a grey pointy beard. Needless to say, these drivers treat busses like go-karts. They drive recklessly and have no regard for safety. With so many deaths on SA roads, this cannot be tolerated anymore. Bus drivers need to start treating busses like the bug peaces of metal running at high speed they are. This of course opens up a whole other can of worms. Government built the train, and broadened the highways to try alleviate traffic problems. Yet, there are still traffic problems. I feel that government should really start promoting safe cycling for cyclists by installing cycle-lanes in our cities. This will encourage more cycling, reduce traffic, and make commuting via a bicycle much safer and feasible. But these sections need to be fenced somehow so that they do not just become another place cars, busses and taxis can stop on. If you agree with this article, share it, please.
