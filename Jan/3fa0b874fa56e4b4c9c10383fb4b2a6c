"The terrorising behaviour of the Zithulele community is unacceptable. Health personnel should be allowed to do their work without any disruptions as they provide an essential service," Sauls-August said in a statement on Thursday. The strike turned violent when community members demanded that hospital staff - who form part of essential services – join them. When Dr Ben Gaunt attempted to negotiate with the protesters to allow staff to continue working, a knobkerrie was used to hit him over the head "Fortunately, Dr Gaunt was not severely injured and returned to work today (Thursday)," the MEC's spokesperson, Lwandile Sicwetsha, said. "It's a criminal act [to prevent] essential services from dealing with patients who require medical attention," Sicwetsha added. The MEC warned: "This incident could trigger a departure of many health professionals who have been servicing the Zithulele community with diligence, and none would want to work in a violent, threatening environment." The hospital is still operating for in-patients. Police were called in to manage the situation at the hospital.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
