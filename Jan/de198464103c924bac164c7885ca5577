Police spokesperson Captain Khaya Tonjeni said the two boys were on the Mpekweni Primary School premises at about 09:00 when the incident took place. "While they were playing, the suspect, 15, stabbed the deceased in the upper body. He was immediately taken to the nearby clinic for medical attention, where he was certified dead on arrival," Tonjeni said. "The circumstances surrounding the incident will form part of the investigation." He said the 15-year-old pupil was arrested and was being "processed in terms of the Child Justice Act". Acting Eastern Cape police commissioner, Major General Andre Swart, said police visits and random searches would be intensified, "even to primary schools". Chairperson of Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Basic Education, Nomalungelo Gina, sent condolences to the family and friends of the deceased pupil and to the school community. "This is indeed a very sad occasion. This young person was robbed of his life at the start of the school year. Instead of looking forward to the academic year, his future is now over. "Our hearts bleed for both families. Their lives will now be changed forever. We want to appeal to the South African population at large to assist our young people to learn the correct skills to deal with conflict as violence is clearly not the solution."
