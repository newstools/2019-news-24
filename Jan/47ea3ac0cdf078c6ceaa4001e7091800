On Friday afternoon ANC Western Cape spokesperson Dennis Cruywagen said Prince has suffered a heart attack at home. "He is said to be recovering and in a stable condition in Beaufort West hospital," he said. Municipal officials were at the hospital at 13:00, but weren't allowed to see Prince. Prince is a previous mayor of Beaufort-West and no stranger to controversy. He has been accused of soliciting teenage prostitutes by investigative television show Special Assignment. He was suspended as municipal manager after this. In 2016 he was accused of assaulting a female police officer.
Also in 2016, the DA laid a charge of corruption against Prince after he
allegedly asked service providers to donate to the ANC's election kitty. He was
also accused of racism and shoving females. He has been found guilty of drunk driving and fined R2 000
after an incident in 2010. In 2014 he was again investigated for drunken
driving. After the 2016 municipal election, the DA in coalition with the Karoo Democratic Force (KDF) took over the Beaufort West municipality's governance from the ANC, who had Prince as its mayor. Last year in June, the KDF's sole councillor Noel Constable sided with the ANC. He became the mayor, with Prince as his deputy.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
