The fire has devastated areas close to Betty's Bay, Pringle Bay, Hangklip and Rooi Els. One person has been reported dead. It is unclear if a murder charge will be added on the charge sheet, should police forensics find that the deceased had died as a result of the fire. On Thursday, police spokesperson Captain Harold Nqwenani told News24 that there were witnesses to the alleged contravention. "We've got witnesses also.
