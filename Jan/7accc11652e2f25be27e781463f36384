Chante Schatz WATCH: Cyclists attacked by 'furious' motorist near Stellenbosch Brendon Jacobs and Jandre Du Raan have been left traumatised after a motorist attacked the pair riding ahead of him near Stellenbosch on Sunday. Two cyclists have been left traumatised after a motorist allegedly attacked the pair near Stellenbosch. Brendon Jacobs and Jandre du Raan were taking a recovery ride to the Jonkershoek Nature Reserve on Sunday. In a post on his Facebook page, Jacobs described how Du Raan hit a pothole and he proceeded to move alongside the other rider to check if his wheels were fine. "About 30 seconds later we heard a hooter and I moved into single file behind Jandre when a driver of a blue Toyota vehicle moved in very, very close to us with the intent to knock us off the bikes," he said. Jacobs and Du Raan's horrific ordeal was not yet over, as a second vehicle pulled up and then joined the first motorist in targeting the pair. 'He was obviously very furious' "After he could not get us by car he then approached us with a stick-type object and then another car stopped out of nowhere and three males and two females assisted the man in the blue car and beat Jandre with a rock," said Jacobs. Jacobs told News24 that he was injured in the back when the motorist hit him with a stick while Du Raan suffered injuries to the head, cheek and eye. "I thought it was a robbery in progress and that's why I took my phone out to film the way he was driving. He was obviously very furious." Western Cape police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana told News24 that cases of reckless and negligent driving and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm were opened for investigation. No arrests have been made so far.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
