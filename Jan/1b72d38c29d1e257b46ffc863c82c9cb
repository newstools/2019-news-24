"The burglars gained entry to the building by removing glass from the window frames. They then dug a hole in one of the walls and broke the burglar doors," MMC for Health and Social Development Lesego Mathibela said in a statement on Wednesday. An armed unit responded to an alarm that was triggered around 02:00 but left the scene when a security guard claimed it was a "false alarm". "As a result, the armed response unit left the scene without inspecting the entire perimeter of the facility," ward councillor Vinay Choonie said. The burglars got away with ten computers. As a result, service delivery was affected, and patients have been directed to the Lenasia South Community Health Centre, a provincial clinic. MMC for Health and Social Development, Councillor Mpho Phalatse has strongly condemned the incident. "Every act of vandalism in our healthcare facilities is a direct attack on our freedom to exercise these rights. We will be partnering with the city's Group Forensic Investigation Services Unit to ensure perpetrators are apprehended, and that an example is made of them that such acts will not go unpunished," Phalatse said. Police are investigating the incident. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
