The City of Cape Town advises residents of Ottery that the Water and Sanitation Department will be replacing valves and hydrants in their area over the coming months. This will result in short, localised supply interruptions as the project progresses. The project is scheduled to run unti Wednesday 6 March, and forms part of the department’s infrastructure replacement programme.According to a statement by the City, residents have been notified via hand-delivered notices about the possible water supply disruptions beforehand, and have been advised to store water upfront in clean, sealed containers on the days they are affected. The City further urges residents to ensure that taps are kept closed to prevent any water damage when supply is restored. “The City regrets any inconvenience caused.”
