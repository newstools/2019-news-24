The video, which has since gone viral on social media, shows officers with their guns pointed at a black truck as a man walks towards them with raised arms. Another person can be seen standing with his arms raised as well. According to Daily Mail, the Florida police were arresting them for suspected shoplifting in the Florida state capital. A 2-year-old child then climbed out of the truck with no shoes and socks on and approached the police, who still had their guns raised. The video, shot by a passerby caused a stir online, with people questioning why police would point a gun at a child. This prompted Tallahassee police to release body cam clips which showed that the officer worked to get the 2-year-old and a younger child, who was strapped in the car, to their mother. "You're okay, come over here sweetie, you're okay. Sweetie, put your hands down, you're fine," one of the officers can be heard comforting the child. Police added that they were armed because staff at the store who reported the culprits said they were armed with pistols and rifles, reports CNN. A pellet gun was found in the back of the pickup truck. According to CNN, the police officers were surprised when the little girl popped out of the truck and approached them. Two men were arrested and later charged with theft, according to police, and the children were taken by their mother.
