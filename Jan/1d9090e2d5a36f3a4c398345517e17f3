DELIVERY service Mr D Food took immediate action last Wednesday, terminating the contract of one of it’s drivers after a video surfaced on the internet and across various social media platforms showing the driver openly masturbating after delivering a food parcel to a young woman. In the video that has since gone viral, the man is seen handing over a package to a woman and, once she turns her back to walk away, the man is seen opening the zip of his pants and masturbating while the woman seemingly remains unaware of what was going on. Head of Mr D Food Devin Sinclair­ condemned the behaviour of the now former-employee and apologised openly for the incident that took place, saying: “Once the incident was brought to our attention we immediately identified the driver and terminated his contract.” Sinclair stated that, since the incident, they had been in contact with the customer’s family and had apologised to the customer and her family for the driver’s behaviour. He added that the family did not want to speak to the media but are looking at taking the necessary steps to open a case against the former Mr D Food employee. Sinclair stated that all drivers go through a strict vetting process via face-to-face interviews with regional branch managers and receive customer service training. Regretful for the incident that took place, Sinclair assures customers and the public that the incident that occurred was not the norm. Since the release of the video there has been an outcry from social media users, with many stating that incidents like this show how dangerous it is for a woman in the modern world and others stating their disgust at the behaviour of the delivery man.
