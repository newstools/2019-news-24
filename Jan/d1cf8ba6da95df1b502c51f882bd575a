	        Send us your pictures   ·  Send us your stories Earlier this week News24 published a story about a Twitter
account purportedly belonging to Nonkanyiso Conco, former president Jacob Zuma's
fiancée and the mother of his youngest son. In compiling the story, we did not verify the authenticity
of the account with Conco before publication. Conco contacted News24 to inform us that the Twitter account
was not hers and was fake. We immediately updated the story. News24 apologises unreservedly to Conco for the
inconvenience caused. This was an oversight on our part and we should have
solicited Conco's comment before running the story. We have removed the article from our archives and also
deleted all social media posts reflecting the incorrect information.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
