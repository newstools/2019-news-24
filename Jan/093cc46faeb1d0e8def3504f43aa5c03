"This appointment is long overdue as the hospital has been without a permanent CEO for three years," DA member of the Gauteng legislature Jack Bloom said in a statement on Thursday. This comes after acting CEO Dr Sifiso Maseko stepped down in August 2018 in the midst of strike action against him over allegations of corruption, maladministration and nepotism.

"She has worked there in the past – occupying various positions including being a clinical director. And we believe that her wealth of experience and distinguished leadership abilities will stabilise the facility," Modisane said. Lesia will be in charge of a R3bn budget and 6 000 employees at the hospital. "I hope that she provides the necessary strong leadership to rebuild morale at the hospital and fix deep-rooted problems that adversely affect the quality of patient care," Bloom said.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
