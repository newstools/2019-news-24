[The suspect] shot himself before police could arrest him," said Tonjeni. Tonjeni said, in another case, three teenagers - aged between 16 and 19 - were arrested in Mthatha's Manyoni township for the alleged rape of a 16-year-old girl. They appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court on December 27. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga issued a warning to citizens to be on guard for criminals and rapists. "Most of the rape cases happen near tavern[s] and victims are usually inebriated. We call upon all police on duty to stamp their authority in closing illegal liquor outlets and enforcing compliance to stipulated times of business for those legal operators," said the province's top cop.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
