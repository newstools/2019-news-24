Marti Will Dam levels in the Free State are still declining consistently as there has been no reasonable rain recorded in recent weeks. This is according to Larry Crisp, communications manager of the Department of Water and Sanitation. “The provincial average water storage was at 73,4% in the week of 15 January. This is a slight improvement from last year’s 65,9%,” says Crisp. “There has been no sign that there will be sufficient rains this season, therefore it is still in our best interest to use water sparingly. “The Department of Water and Sanitation wishes to remind water users that the 20% water restrictions status quo still remains in place,” he says. The department measures dam levels across the country on a weekly basis in order to take informed decisions when it comes to the distribution of water to relevant dams for consumption by communities. The current decline in dam levels can be attributed to a lower than normal rainfall and the heat wave that is experienced in most parts of the province. According to last week’s reports, the water level of the Kalkfontein Dam is currently at 22,1%. The level of the Sterkfontein Dam is at 94,0%, the Gariep Dam at 71,9% and the Krugersdrift Dam at 38,2%. The Groothoek Dam’s level is at 39,4%, and that of the Rustfontein Dam decreased from 27,1% last week to 26,8% which is slightly better than 22,4% where it was last year the same time. The level of the Fika Patso Dam is at a low 37,2%. The department appeals to communities, including businesses, to use the resource with extra care. “We appeals to communities to fix leaks and burst pipes in and around their homes. “Pipe burst from the main line should be reported to the local municipality,” says Crisp.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
