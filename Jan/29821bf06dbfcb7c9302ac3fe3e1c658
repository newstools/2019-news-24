This comes days after the KwaZulu-Natal department of health secured 300 vacancies for nurses in the province as a part of President Cyril Ramaphosa's stimulus package. The programme is aimed at boosting the public health sector through the creation of more than 5 300 jobs in SA.

The cost currently accounts for 60% of the department of health’s budget, making it difficult to create new jobs or absorb professionals, according to Lukhele. Lukhele also assured affected staff members that despite challenges face by the department, work is being done to resolve the hinderances relating to placements. “I would like to appeal for their patience and cooperation at this crucial time,” Lukhele concluded.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
