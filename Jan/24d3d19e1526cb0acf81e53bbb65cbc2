"The suspects spotted the police officers and a shootout ensued," Captain Nqobile Gwala said in a statement on Wednesday. One of the suspects sustained gunshot wounds and was taken to a hospital for medical attention under police guard while the other was found hiding in a bush was arrested. The suspects, aged 36 and 38, were detained at Umlazi police station. Police recovered two 38 special revolvers with ammunition that are still subject to ballistic testing to establish if they were used in other crimes in KwaZulu-Natal.
