WHATSAPP messenger service is limiting the number of times a user can forward a message to five, in a bid to fight “misinformation and rumours”, company executives said recently. “We’re imposing a limit of five messages all over the world as of today,” Victoria Grand, vice president for policy and communications at WhatsApp, said at an event in the Indonesian capital. Previously, a WhatsApp user could forward a message to 20 individuals or groups. The five-recipient limit expands globally a measure WhatsApp put into place in India in July after the spread of rumours on social media led to killings and lynching attempts. WhatsApp, which has around 1,5 billion users, has been trying to find ways to stop misuse of the app following global concern that the platform was being used to spread fake news, manipulated visuals and audio hoaxes, with no way to monitor their origin or full reach. The Facebook-owned app’s end-to-end encryption allows groups of hundreds of users to exchange messages beyond the purview of independent fact checkers. WhatsApp rolled out an update to activate the new forwarding limit from yesterday, said WhatsApp’s head of communications Carl Woog. Android users will receive the update first, followed by users of Apple’s iOS. — Reuters.
