Dear Ms Dudu Myeni, don't you know that pulling out the race card to draw attention away from yourself is getting very time worn and an old hat these days? Because Agrizzi is 'white', it doesn't necessarily make him a liar, does it?And accusing someone else of being greedy is hardly a defence either. Ever heard about the pot and the kettle? Plus, calling someone 'bitter' just because they are revealing an alleged truth about you receiving a bribe of R300 000 every month also isn't much of a legal defence. Really, it's not. So Dudu, it would seem you really need to get yourself a good lawyer. Because the former presidentÂ  - your one-time 'just a good friend' - is himself also getting dragged deeper and deeper into a story of alleged massive corruption. No help coming from there, I'm afraid. Because the way evidence has been coming out these last few days, it does appear like you could possibly be... just might be... rather deep in the Dudu.
