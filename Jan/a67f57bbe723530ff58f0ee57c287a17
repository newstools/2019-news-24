The Electoral Commission announced the dates for its second and final voter registration weekend for the 2019 national and provincial elections. The country’s 22 932 voting stations will open from 08:00 to 17:00. This will allow first-time voters to register and existing voters to update and to check their registration details. Currently there are 26.1 million registered voters on the national common voters’ roll and it is hoped that at least one million voters will be added to the voters’ roll ahead of the 2019 elections. The Electoral Commission is also hopeful that voters who are already registered will use the opportunity to visit their voting station to check their registration and specifically to confirm and update their address details. Registered voters can visit the Electoral Commission website (www.elections.org.za) to check their current registration details and voting station location. They can also SMS their ID number to 32810 to receive an SMS containing their registration status and the address of their voting station (charged at R1). Unregistered voters can insert their address in the Voting Station Finder application on the website (http://maps.elections.org.za/vsfinder/) to find their correct voting station or call the contact centre. An online facility (www.elections.org.za/MyIEC) is also available for registered voters with access to the internet to update and review their address online.
