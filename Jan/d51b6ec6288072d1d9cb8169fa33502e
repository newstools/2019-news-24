South Africans head to the polls in about four months to elect new national and provincial governments. While President Cyril Ramaphosa has not yet set a date for the elections in May, members of the public have one last opportunity to register to vote. For those who still need to register at a ward, or are unsure of whether they are registered at the correct ward, 22 932 voting stations will open from 08:00 to 17:00 on Saturday, January 26 and Sunday, January 27. This period will also give an opportunity to existing voters to update and check their registration details, either online or at a voting station. CHECK your registration details online. According to the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC), here are the most important things you need to know about the registration weekend: If you miss registering during the weekend, you can still register at your local IEC office during office hours until the election date is proclaimed. Voter registration weekend for South Africans in New York City and throughout the Tri-State Area is February 2 and February 3, 9am-4pm.Consulate address ????333 East 38th Street, 9th FloorNew York, NY 10016#CountryDuty pic.twitter.com/zDYyGfwOy9  KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
