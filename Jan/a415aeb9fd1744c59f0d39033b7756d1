"As I walked back from the voting station to my car, two men approached me and grabbed the camera strap; as I resisted, the one guy pulled out a pretty big knife, cut the strap and took the camera," Gerber said. Gerber then got into his car for safety. Once in his car, he looked around for the perpetrators, but they had already disappeared. Gerber has opened a charge of robbery with the South African Police Service.
