The institution's management met with members of Sasco from 09:00 until about 15:00, but could not find common ground on some of the grievances raised. "The management and members of Sasco met today (Tuesday) and only agreed on two out of the six issues raised. Therefore no agreement was reached to stop the shutdown," Unisa spokesperson Martin Ramotshela explained to News24.

In the interim, the institution encouraged students to register online "in the interest of safety" until the matter was resolved. The institution was unclear about when the next meeting would take place. The Sunnyside campus was shut down on Monday after Sasco members claimed that several demands, ranging from NSFAS issues to fee increases, had not been addressed by management.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
