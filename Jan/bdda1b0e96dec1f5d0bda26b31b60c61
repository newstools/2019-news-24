Alex Mitchley The ANC in Gauteng plans to hit the ground running as it aims to get more people to register to vote, following the launch of the party's elections manifesto over the weekend. Final voter registration is set to take place on January 26 and 27, ahead of the elections in May. The registration drive would be led by provincial office bearers and the executive committee with the intention of covering all five regions in the province, ANC Gauteng provincial secretary Jacob Khawe said. "The PEC (provincial executive committee) will also use this drive to take our 2019 manifesto to the residents of Gauteng," Khawe said in a statement. WATCH: ANC shakes up Durban with manifesto launch A crowd of around 85 000 people joined the ANC at their manifesto launch at the Moses Mabhida stadium on Saturday. "Following the call made by the president of the ANC, Comrade Cyril Ramaphosa, we will continue to take up and resolve community issues as we work towards growing South Africa." Khawe added that the voter registration drive came hot on the heels of "a successfully convened manifesto launch in Durban". 'Reforms in economic sectors' "We urge and encourage all residents to make sure they will be counted during the 2019 general elections, by registering to vote." The PEC will kick off the campaign trail on Tuesday in the West Rand region of Gauteng. During the party's election manifesto launch at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday, Ramaphosa said the ANC planned to grow the economy. "For several years, investment in the economy – both by government and businesses – has stagnated, stifling growth and job creation," Ramaphosa said. He said they would work with all social partners to restore investor, business, and consumer confidence and "ensure policy consistency and certainty". "We will implement reforms in economic sectors that have the greatest potential to grow and create jobs," Ramaphosa said. 'An inclusive economy' He also said the ANC-led government would take measures to lower the cost of doing business in the country, increase productivity and improve competitiveness. In addition, News24 reported that Ramaphosa said the manifesto was for an inclusive economy. He said the ANC-led government would build an economy in which the majority of South Africans could have a meaningful stake and benefit from. "For centuries, the majority of South Africans have been deliberately excluded from economic activity, disposed of land, deprived of skills and forcibly settled far from economic opportunities. This exclusion is greatest among women, rural people and youth," he said. Ramaphosa promised that the party would enable workers to own stakes in the companies they work for and "to share in the profits". "We will open up markets for new emerging companies by ending monopolies and behaviour that stifles competition. We will draw more women, more rural people and more youth into the economy by expanding access to digital skills training to young people."
