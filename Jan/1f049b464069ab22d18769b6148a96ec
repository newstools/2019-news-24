This will allow the institution to continue making offers, based on the availability of space, to thousands of student hopefuls. While the process has frustrated many students, the university said it was doing all it could to ensure that those who had applied were offered places. "We are now processing all those [new] applications, and we have now extended the deadline to Thursday the 31st. What is going to happen between now and then is that offers will be made to students within the context of the space available," Unisa spokesperson Martin Ramotshela said. Ramotshela said the university initially targeted 380 000 enrolments for the 2019 academic plan, but received more than 500 000 applications. "We will make offers as we process them (the applications). In fact, we are very close to the number. We make offers as we process the applications and when we reach the target, we close. No one is on a waiting list, you are just an applicant," he said. Ramotshela urged students to register as soon as possible and not to wait for the deadline. He added that the academic programme for the year, including the submission of assignments and examinations, remained unchanged.
