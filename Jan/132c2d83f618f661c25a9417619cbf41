According to the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD), the woman was caught clocking 107 km/h in a 70 km/h zone in her white BMW 1 series along Swartkoppies Road. In a statement, EMPD acting spokesperson Kobeli Mokheseng said the woman got out of her vehicle and demanded to see the camera reading, before she returned to the car and locked herself in. Her mother then arrived on the scene and started causing a "ruckus", calling the officers names and telling them that they couldn't arrest her daughter because she paid their salaries. "Back up was called and Brackendowns SAPS members responded...the driver was requested to step out of the vehicle before she was arrested along with her mother," said Mokheseng. He added that the 49-year-old woman and her daughter were detained at Brackendowns police station. Among the charges are reckless and negligent driving, resisting arrest, failing to furnish information and with interfering with officers while on duty. The two are expected to appear in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court soon.
