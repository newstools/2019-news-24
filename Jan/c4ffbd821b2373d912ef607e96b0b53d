"They demanded a R20 000 bribe, the shop owner gave them R5 000 and would pay the balance later," JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said in a statement on Thursday. The foreign national who was allegedly caught trying to sell a fake ID on December 2, paid the officers R5 000 and agreed to settle the full bribe amount at a later stage. The shop owner then lodged a complaint with the JMPD internal affairs unit and the South African Police Service. The businessman is currently being investigated for fraud and is yet to be arrested. "When there is evidence against him then he will be arrested," Minnaar told News24 on Thursday. Two female officers and one male officer were arrested at the JMPD offices on Loveday Street and were detained at the Hillbrow police station."An internal investigation is also underway," Minnaar said.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
