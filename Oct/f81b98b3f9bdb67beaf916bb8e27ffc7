Colleagues
of Rudi van de Venter (48) are still in shock over the news of the North-West
University (NWU) lecturer’s death at the weekend on the Potchefstroom campus. “It’s
always hard for the university’s and faculty management to lose a colleague but
it’s made worse by the fact that it was a freak accident,” Louis Jacobs, NWU
spokesman, tells YOU. The campus’
security systems indicate Rudi arrived on campus at 2am on Saturday morning. A
security guard found his body shortly after 6am. He’d fallen into a trench that
was dug on campus for renovations on campus. “The
students are starting their exams soon but we can’t speculate as to the reasons
why he was on campus at that time of the [morning] or what happened. The police
autopsy will have to determine cause of death,” Louis says. “The
circumstances are tough to accept. Rudi was a remarkable person. He was very
smart and an excellent maths lecturer,” says Professor Lloyd Conley, dean of
the education faculty were Rudi had been a lecturer. Louis
confirms the faculty has made trauma counsellors available to the staff of the
education faculty, Rudi’s students and family members. “The
students start exams at the end of next week so our first priority was to
ensure they’re okay,” Louis says. Some of
Rudi’s colleagues have laid flowers at his office door. “He was a brilliant
lecturer and a wonderful person,” one colleague said. “He touched
many people’s lives. I’m incredibly proud to be able to say he was part of our
faculty,” Lloyd says.
