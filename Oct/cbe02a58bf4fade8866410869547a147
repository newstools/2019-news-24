A four-year-old boy is being heralded as a hero after he rescued
his two-year-old sister from drowning in the family pool. The siblings’ mom, Laura Forrester of Tennessee in
the US, said the incident happened very quickly and that her children had been
in her sight just five minutes earlier, PEOPLE reports. While Laura’s back was turned, Andie (2) managed to get around the
security measures installed around the backyard pool and accidentally fell in. The little girl struggled to stay afloat but fortunately her
brother, Gray, was there to save her. “She was doggy-paddling . . . I grabbed her
tummy. I was trying to lift her so she could breathe,” now five-year-old
Gray told local media. The mom-of-two said she was shocked when Andie walked up to her and
told her she’d fallen into the pool, TODAY
reports. “Andie walked up and was like, ‘I falled in the
pool, I falled in the pool!’ She was soaking wet and then I looked at Gray and
he was soaking wet and I just panicked,” she recalled. “I flashed forward so many times on how it
happened so fast, ‘cause they’d just been with me not even five minutes
before.” Laura said the incident scared her because she thought she’d taken
all necessary precautions. “We installed the safety fence and the kids knew
never to go out there without an adult or babysitter,” she said. “We installed beeps on the doors. We thought
we’d taken all the precautions.” Laura has since enrolled her daughter in swimming classes. “[I hope] if people hear this story and they live
close to the water, a lake or a pool or whatever, that they’d consider signing
up for this class because no matter what precautions you take, it can still
happen.”  Sources: PEOPLE, TODAY
