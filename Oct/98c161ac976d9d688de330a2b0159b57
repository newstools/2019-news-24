A 44-year-old Durban father, who is accused of killing four of his children, appeared stoic and calm in the Pinetown Magistrate's Court on Wednesday, this despite an additional charge of rape being added to his case. The rape charge was joined to the case this week, and is unrelated to the murder of the four children. The father, who has not yet pleaded to the rape charge, appeared confused about his legal representative during proceedings. "My family said a private lawyer would be here. If he is not here, I will have to use Legal Aid," he told the court.

Following proceedings, political parties again took centre stage outside the courthouse with singing and protesting of abuse against women and children. News24 previously reported that the man had allegedly sent their 10-year-old back and forth to the tuckshop to buy snacks, so he would have time to murder his four and six-year-old children, according to their mother. The three youngest children were hung using clothing. He allegedly attempted to hang the fourth away from the family home but failed and instead strangled her. The matter was postponed for further investigation until Thursday, November 7.
