In a joint operation on Wednesday morning (2 October) involving Lwandle police, the provincial Firearm and Liquor Unit and Law Enforcement, one suspect was arrested at his Asanda Village home for dealing in liquor without a licence. Lwandle police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Gama said officers were on patrol when they noticed a place selling liquor without a licence. He said they immediately entered the house to investigate and found people consuming liquor. “The officials searched and found alcohol on the premises,” said Gama. “Police requested a liquor licence from the owner, who couldn’t provide one. They confiscated about 250 litres of alcohol.” The 40-year-old man was arrested and charged for selling liquor without a licence. The suspect will appear in Strand Magistrates’ Court next Tuesday (8 October).
