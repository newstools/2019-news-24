Police arrested two suspects and recovered a truck that was stolen in Edenvale, Ekurhuleni, on Tuesday afternoon.   According to police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters, police were on routine patrol in Edenvale when they noticed a suspicious man driving a truck on Linksfield Road. As the police were approaching, the suspect allegedly got out of the truck and jumped into a nearby Toyota Rush with two occupants. "Police gave chase as the suspects were driving onto the N3 highway. The suspects allegedly started shooting at the police who then returned fire, forcing the suspect's vehicle to a sudden halt. Two suspects jumped out and fled on foot. One suspect was cornered and arrested while the other suspect evaded arrest," Peters said.
