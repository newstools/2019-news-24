Five suspects are still at large following an attempted house robbery in Winchester Hills, Johannesburg, on Tuesday. CCTV footage, which has been widely circulated on social media platforms, shows a white Audi parked outside the home. It also shows a crowbar-wielding man climbing out of the vehicle. He uses it to pry open a locked gate after which a group of four men run onto the property. Not long after, the men leave in a hurry.Â It is unclear why they fled. While provincial police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini confirmed the incident to News24, he said a case had not been opened. "We sent police officers to the scene but the owner of the house declined to open the gate." He said the homeowner refused to open a case because nothing was stolen and no one was injured. Dlamini urged people who find themselves in similar situations to open cases. "This is to track down these people because they are maybe involved in other crimes."
