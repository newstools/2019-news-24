A family outing to a dam ended in
tragedy after four members of the same family drowned while trying to take a
selfie. A 20-year old newlywed and her
25-year-old husband were visiting relatives when they, along with four other
family members, decided to visit the Pambar dam in the southern Indian state of
Tamil Nadu, People reports. According to the Independent, the group of six were holding hands
and standing in waist-deep water when one of the group – a 14-year-old boy –
slipped underwater, pulling the others in too. The groom, who was taking the
picture, managed to steady himself and rescue his sister from the water, which
had risen during the time they were there, but the other four disappeared
underwater. Their bodies were later recovered and
post-mortem examinations were done. According to CNN, a 2018 study shows that India has recorded the
highest number of selfie deaths of any country in the world. Authorities in India have launched
campaigns to warn people against posing for dangerous pictures. Last month, a woman reportedly fell
200 ft (60m) to her death while taking a snap of herself on a clifftop in
western India. Sources: People, Independent, CNN
