Con artists have found a new way to steal your cash â€“ by using your own phone and cash-sending services. Eastern Cape police have issued a warning after two men were conned in separate incidents last week by three women posing as Vodacom agents in Vincent Park, East London. Police spokesperson Captain Mluleki Mbi said the women approached the men, pretending that they wanted to help them by "viewing how much talking points and airtime they have on their phones as they are running a promotion". "After having handed over their cellphones to these ladies, the victims would later discover that money has been taken from their accounts via eWallet." Cash-sending services allow bank account holders to send money to anyone with a South African cellphone number. Two cases of fraud were under investigation, Mbi said. He warned members of the public to always be vigilant and to protect their cellphones and ATM cards. - Compiled by Tammy Petersen
