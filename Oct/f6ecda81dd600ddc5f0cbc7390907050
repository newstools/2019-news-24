Rehana
Moshoeshoe from Kimberley in the Northern Cape was 15 years old when she went
missing in 2010. On the afternoon she disappeared the
Kimberley Girls’ High School learner had gone to meet friends in town but never
returned home. An extensive police search involving several police units proved
fruitless. And Rehana is still missing. A YouTube
video that started circulating on social media about a month ago, shows an
interview with a homeless young woman in Pretoria talking about her life on the
streets. Many people noticed a strong likeness between the woman and the
missing girl from Kimberley. Captain
Sergio Kock, a police spokesperson in Kimberley, confirmed that the matter is
being investigated. Police are awaiting the results of DNA tests to establish
if the woman in the video is Rehana. “It’s
impossible to say when the results will be available. In the meantime, there’s
no point in speculating,” Captain Kock said. A week
after the 15-year-old went missing in 2010, Frans Olifant (then 38) from
Lichtenburg was arrested. He’d made several calls to the girl and sent text
messages, including on the day she disappeared, he couldn’t explain to police. Detectives
were however able to connect Olifant to other crimes, including rape, theft and
arson, and he was sentenced to 36 years in prison.
