The
body of a two-year-old Herolds Bay boy who went missing with his mother and
sister was recovered on Thursday afternoon, Southern Cape police have confirmed. "The news was broken to the
dad earlier today," said spokesperson Captain Malcolm Pojie. "We held off on [releasing
the information] because we considered his feelings." Pojie said the body was found
floating in a gorge near where their VW Caravelle was discovered earlier. "The body was recovered and
removed by pathology services and taken to the mortuary." PICS
