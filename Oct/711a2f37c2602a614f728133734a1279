IN CELEBRATION of Heritage Day, the Kwa­Zulu-Natal Museum hosted an event to celebrate South Africa’s literary classics in the year of indigenous languages on Friday, September 20 at the KZN Museum. Dumisani Jali of the KZN Museum said: “The museum is the most perfect place to celebrate Heritage Day.” Jali added that the purpose of the event was to celebrate the diversity and unity of the people living in SA: “This event is also aimed at reminding us of who we are because, with everything that has been happening in the country recently, such as the killing of women and children, it’s evident we have forgotten who we are as people.” He also noted that crimes such as rape occur when people in the community forget their roles as parents and guardians but, most importantly, their roles as human beings. He said the event served to remind people of Ubuntu and the significance of looking after one another while celebrating each other. Guest speaker Dr Thembinkosi Biyela of Indoni gave an address on culture in relation to the youth while Dr Ghilraen Laue of KZN Museum delivered a presentation on what heritage is, the people, objects and their stories. Book author Mlekeleli Mbanjwa, who gave a talk on creative writing in indigenous languages, emphasised some of the reasons why he feels people should write in their vernacular language, saying: “I believe there is truth and emphasis when one writes in their indigenous language. There is cohesion in the writing because the person understands the language better than any learnt language.” The event featured poetry reading and those who attended were taken on a tour of the heritage site. The museum’s gallery was also officially opened.
