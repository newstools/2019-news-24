I refer to Naseema Barday’s article, "Homosexuality to be punishable by death in Uganda", October 11, 2019. It is disturbing that most of Africa continues to egregiously persecute minorities simply based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Major strides in scientific research indicate that our genetics largely determines our sexual orientation. It is estimated that between 30% to 70% is genetically determined (A critical review of recent biological research on human sexual orientation. Annual Review of Sex Research – 2002). There have been many similar scientific findings. Discrimination based on sexual and gender identity is much like being prejudiced because someone has a different eye or skin colour to what is more commonly found. In 1994, the UN Human Rights Committee declared that laws criminalising consensual same-sex relations between adults violate international human rights. We urge the SA government to condemn this colonial-style Ugandan law and to be as vocal about it as they are about matters concerning discrimination based on race.
