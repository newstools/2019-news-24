SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said, “We are making an appeal
to anyone with valuable information that can assist the police in apprehending
the suspect(s) to come forward, or anyone who can be able to recognize the
person running in the footage or picture below, to contact Lieutenant Colonel
Richard Boshomane at 0798945501 or may call the toll free number 0860010111
[sic].” According to Mojapelo, the two victims, Valtyn
Kekana (54) and Ralph Kanyane (32) were killed by an unknown assailant in July.
Even though there’s CCTV footage, it has been hard to identify the suspects. Valtyn Kekana was
chairperson of municipal public accounts committee in the Mogalakwena
municipality, and Alf Kanyane was the party’s branch secretary in the region. “The deceased were apparently seated in a
vehicle when the gunman approached and, at point blank, immediately started
firing shots at them. They both died at the scene. The assailant allegedly fled
from the scene on foot after the incident,” explained Mojapelo. He says callers may choose to remain
anonymous and confidentiality for any information received will be guaranteed. Watch
