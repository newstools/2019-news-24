A woman from Polokwane in Limpopo is in a critical but stable condition in hospital after she was attacked and mauled by a family member’s two pitbulls. Ronelle Seitz (59) was visiting family on Saturday when the dogs attacked her. “It was so bad that they couldn’t get the dogs off her,” says Tess Riekert from the charity organisation Back on Your Feet. She says the dogs refused to let go of Ronelle and two police officers on the scene had to shoot them to get them off her. She was taken to the Netcare Hospital Polokwane where doctors have begun to treat her most serious wounds. The dogs had pulled off her scalp and she sustained serious bites on her arms and legs. Ronelle will have to undergo plastic surgery to repair the damage to her scalp. A large bite on her leg will also require surgery. “She needs immediate treatment for her injuries – treatment she won’t necessarily receive at a state hospital,” Tess says. “Ronelle doesn’t have medical aid and we’re struggling to raise funds to keep her in a private hospital. She’s in the high-care unit and we urgently need funds to keep her there.”
