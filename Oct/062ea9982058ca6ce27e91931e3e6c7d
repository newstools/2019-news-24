The current reports on the alleged poor conduct of Professor
Peter Beale have left me in disbelief and with a lot of questions. Some of the
personality traits being attributed to Prof Beale of being arrogant and rude are at
variance with the man I dealt with in 2018 when I took my one-year-old son for
a surgical excision. The service we got from Prof Beale was excellent and his
communication was second to none. It is therefore a surprise to me to see only
negative reports about him in the media. I am also sorry for the parents that
might have lost their kids after some medical procedures with the Prof.
However, I believe proper investigations are always required to understand the
causes such unfortunate incidents before blaming the Prof. It is also important
to seek balanced reporting on such matters. Negative media reports have a
negative impact on someone's profession, even if the victim of the negative
reporting is exoneratedÂ at a later date.
