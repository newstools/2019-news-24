It took just less than a year for a robbery case to reach an ending worth celebrating, as a conviction prevailed. Two men have been found guilty and sentenced for robbing an Athlone business in October last year. Athlone police station’s corporate communications officer, Sgt Zita Norman shared the news with People’s Post on Wednesday 25 September. According to Norman, Mathamsanqa Madubela, 18, and Simphiwe Nxiba, 33, robbed the TAB horseracing building in Aden Avenue. The police were quick to respond and retrieved R300 000 from the suspects. She said the investigation and the case took less than a year to be wrapped up. For her, that highlights how hardworking the police are and how efficient the justice system is. At the forefront of the successful arrest was investigating officer, Sgt Daniel Solomons. Solomons opposed bail and the case was transferred to the regional court where the two accused agreed to a plea bargain on Wednesday 11 September. They were sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment of which five years are suspended and they were declared unfit to possess a firearm. Norman commended Solomons and further appealed to the community to continue reporting criminal activities to the police. “Residents are the eyes and ears of the police. Had they not reported it, we would not have known about the men,” she explained. She thanked the community for working with the police in curbing crime and stressed that community involvement is very important. She said crime effects each and every one out there and that working together could make a difference.
