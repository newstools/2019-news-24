 A father and his son were burnt to death
after their shack caught on fire on Tuesday morning in Mamelodi. The father of twins died while trying to
save one of his sons, who was still trapped in the burning house. Mamelodi SAPS spokesperson Captain Johannes
Maheso confirmed to Move! that the incident occurred in the wee hours of
Tuesday morning. Johannes said some members of the family
managed to escape the blaze. “Mamelodi East Police and paramedics
responded to a call by community about a burning shack on Tuesday morning at
about 02:00, extension 11 Mamelodi East,” he said. On arrival they were informed that a 13
roomed shack caught fire in the early hours of the morning and was noticed by
neighbours, who woke up the occupants, tried to extinguish the fire and also
called the police. It is alleged that the family of four, father,
wife and two twins, a boy and girl,  together with two tenants were sleeping in the
shack when the fire broke out. “The mother managed to escape and saved the
10-year-old girl child while the father and the boy child were trapped inside
and succumbed to the tragedy,” he explained. It is also alleged that two tenants who
were also sleeping inside, each in his room, managed to escape. “The police have registered an inquest took
the bodies to government mortuary for postmortem. In line with the safety and
security of our community, the police would like sensitise our community to be
aware of any devices or situations which can cause fire inside houses,” he
cautioned Johannes said the case is still under
