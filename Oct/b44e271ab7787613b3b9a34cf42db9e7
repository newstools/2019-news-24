Ocean View police were met with an unexpected challenge and went beyond their call of duty, rescuing an abandoned baby in Gugulethu. Sgt Leon Fortuin, spokesperson for Ocean View police was with personnel principal official Natalie Mdingi and chief admin clerk Bertha Jeneke, delivering a firearm to another police station when a resident approached them in need of their assistance. “We went to Nyanga police station to hand over a firearm to them that was recovered in Ocean View, which was stolen in their (Nyanga) area. “When we got to the station, a man approached us and informed us that a woman had given birth to a child two roads behind the police station and (she) ran away.” Following the resident, they found the baby laying in an alley next to a shack in Gugulethu. The baby was initially found by a resident, Gloria Mzanyo. “The umbilical cord was attached to the baby and the afterbirth was still there,” he explained. He informed Nyanga police, who had no vehicles to dispatch to the scene at the time. He also called the ambulance, who informed him that the area in which the baby was found requires a police escort. “Because we found the baby laying in the sand and in the sun, we thought the safety of the baby was of utmost importance and we transported the baby to Gugulethu Community Health Centre,” he added. The baby was examined by the nursing staff and found to be a perfectly healthy baby boy. The baby will be monitored and handed over to social services, should he remain in healthy condition. Gugulethu police have opened a docket for a case of child abandonment.
