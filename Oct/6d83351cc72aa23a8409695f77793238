The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Simon’s Town was called to duty to assist with three beached whales at 10:03 on Saturday 5 October. Andrew de Kock, duty coxswain, said: “NSRI Simon’s Town and NSRI Kommetjie duty crews were activated to assist Table Mountain National Parks rangers at Buffels Bay, Cape Point, who were dealing with three Gray’s beaked whales, beached among rocks on the shoreline.” Marine scientists and the department of environmental affairs for oceans and coasts were also dispatched to the scene. “Two of the whales were found dead and one whale was recovered, assessed by vets and marine scientists and deemed to be in poor health,” he said. The whale died as a result of his poor condition a short while later.
