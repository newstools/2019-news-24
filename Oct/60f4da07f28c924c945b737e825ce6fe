an image in which Uyinene appears alongside Riky Rick. The Global Citizen campaign helps raise funds
to ease poverty and address other social issues around the world A Twitter user wrote: “I
can’t believe Riky Rick and his team are using Uyinene’s picture to promote
their event.”  Another user wrote: “What’s wrong with the
picture is that it’s being used to promote a party. Whether it was there 5

from their promotional content.
