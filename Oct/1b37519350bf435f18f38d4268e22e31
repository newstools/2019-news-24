The British parliament may end up forcing Prime Minister Boris Johnson to request another Brexit delay and give only provisional support to his divorce deal with the EU. An amendment written by former government minister Oliver Letwin forces Johnson to write a letter to Brussels requesting an extension of the Brexit deadline until January 31, 2020.

Jeremy Corbyn: We will not back this sell-out deal Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reacts to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's update to the House of Commons on his new Brexit deal,  saying "voting for a deal today won't end Brexit. It won't deliver certainty and the people should have the final say", ad... But Letwin's amendment, which was selected by House of Commons Speaker John Bercow, would decline to approve Johnson's deal in full "unless and until" every other part of the formal Withdrawal Agreement Bill is passed. Johnson hopes to introduce the formal bill next week once MPs have voted on Saturday's political agreement. Letwin says he backs Johnson's agreement but is concerned that lawmakers might fail to push through the required Brexit implementation mechanism by the October 31 deadline. This would, theoretically, result in a "no-deal" split at the end of the month, a scenario Letwin's amendment is designed to avoid.
