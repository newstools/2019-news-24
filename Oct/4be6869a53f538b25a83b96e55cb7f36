"There are chances of some hail, heavy downpours and some strong winds to come along with these thunderstorms over the highveld areas of Mpumalanga, the eastern and northern parts of Gauteng and southwestern parts of Limpopo," Mahlangu said. While there is a 30% chance of thunderstorms in the southern Drakensberg, Lesotho, there are no signs of snow at this stage, Mahlangu said. Very light flurries may occur at higher altitudes in the Drakensberg near Sani Pass, Snow Report SA reported. No rain is expected in the Western Cape, but light showers may occur in the coastal areas. The weather conditions are expected to go on for the next seven days in different parts of the country, Mahlangu said. - Compiled by Sesona Ngqakamba
