matric dance on Thursday, 10 October. According to Eastern Cape provincial SAPS spokesperson,
Captain Khaya Tonjeni, the pupils were at their school dance in Mpa locality in

altercation broke out between the four boys at around 23:54, which then
resulted in a stabbing where one of them lost his life” Captain Tonjeni said. NPA spokesperson Luxolo Tyali confirmed to Drum that the
20-year-old men remained in police custody while awaiting their bail hearing
