Two
suspects appeared in the Upington Magistrates' Court in the Northern Cape for
charges relating to vehicle fraud. The Hawks arrested Marius Jacobs
and Jan-ray April for allegedly using fraudulent documents to purchase a
vehicle in April last year. "Jacobs and April bought the
R350 000 vehicle using a fraudulent payslip, [and] a fake job employment
confirmation accompanied with a permanent contract. "The two managed to get away
with a bank approved vehicle loan of a Golf GTI," Hawks spokesperson Nomthandazo
Mnisi said in a statement on Sunday. The bank uncovered the scheme and
reported it to the Hawks. A detailed investigation resulted in the arrest of
the pair and the seizure of the vehicle. They
were granted R1 000 bail each and are due back in court on November 20.
