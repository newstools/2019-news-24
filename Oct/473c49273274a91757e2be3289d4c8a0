The Western Cape minister of cultural affairs and sport, Anroux Marais submitted an application to the national minister of arts and culture, Nathi Mthethwa, validating her support for the proposed name change of Zonnebloem to District Six on Sunday 29 September. Marais is supporting an initiative started by the District Six Museum a year ago when it raised awareness of the proposed name change through door-to-door campaigns and using local media. The museum then applied to the Western Cape Provincial Geographical Names Committee (WCPGNC) after which the museum had to present its application to the committee in February this year. WCPGNC resolved to support the application at a meeting held in June and then passed it on to Marais. “It is hoped the name change will clearly communicate to the community and residents of District Six that you have been seen, you have been heard and that you do belong,” she said.
