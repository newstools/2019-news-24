Dozens of foreign nationals on Wednesday camped outside the Cape Town offices of the UN refugee agency demanding to be removed from South Africa, and saying they were no longer safe. Around 250 foreigners, many claiming to be asylum seekers from various African countries, vowed not to leave the premises until the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) addressed their concerns.

"We are here because we want the UN and other organisations to help... refugees, to take us somewhere safe," said Radjab Mugemangango 47, a Rwandan Uber driver.

The continent's most industrialised economy attracts people from neighbouring Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Others come from farther afield including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria and South Asian countries. Seen as competing with locals for jobs, they are often the first to come under fire when South Africa's chronic unemployment, inequality and poverty boils into xenophobic outlash.

"Everywhere we are facing discrimination, there is no dignity for refugees in this country. We are tired," said Sukami, pleading with the UNHCR to "find peace for us".

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari last week denounced recent xenophobic violence in South Africa as an "embarrassment" for the continent, as he wrapped up a state visit here. The violence sparked fury in Nigeria and saw hundreds of migrant workers repatriated.
