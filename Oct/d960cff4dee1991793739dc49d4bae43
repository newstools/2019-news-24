OPERATIONS in uMvoti Municipality resumed this week after municipal workers embarked on a go-slow last week. Refuse collection and other services were interrupted after workers downed tools due to a number of concerns about salaries. In a meeting held at the Greytown Town Hall between the union and municipal employees affiliated to the Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union (Imatu), workers claimed that they were being underpaid by the municipality. They also discussed salary increments and one of the workers present at the meeting, Delani Mzolo, claimed that he was only paid R15 in August. uMvoti Municipality spokesperson Phindile Phungula said: “A go-slow taken by uMvoti­ municipal employees resulted in the disruption of the delivery of basic services by the municipality. This go-slow [was] informed by an internal disciplinary process yet to take place which implicates numerous employees. “We assure the public that management is working at resolving the matter speedily and thus resume normal functionality of the municipality.”
