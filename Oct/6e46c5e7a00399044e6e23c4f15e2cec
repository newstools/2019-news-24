“Everyone is still in shock. And with the crime rate in our
country, we suspect it’s another heartbreaking crime story,” says the niece of
the Mamelodi man who has been missing since last week. Tumagole Modiba
(62) was last seen at Silverton Shopping Centre around 10am on Tuesday 15 October. According to Tumagole’s niece,
Tebogo Modiba, her uncle had parked his vehicle at the car wash next to Uitkyk butchery in Silverton before he went
missing. “He then phoned his fiancée to meet
up so they can go buy meat as she works at the same complex.” “She waited for quite some time and
he didn’t arrive,” she explains. The police spokesperson, captain
Jan Sepato, told Pretoria East Rekord
that his partner became suspicious and called him. When he answered the phone,
he had told his fiancée that he was on his way back home. “She was unconvinced by the manner [in
which] he spoke and decided to look for him at the car wash,” the captain told
Pretoria East Rekord. Tebogo said when she went to check
on his vehicle at the car wash, they were still busy cleaning it. “She then phoned his number again, it
rang, then someone dropped it.” And eventually
it was off after trying numerous times. That’s when the family notified the
police, who went to his workplace but he was nowhere to be found. Tebogo says money has been withdrawn from her uncle’s
account. “The police managed to retrieve a
copy of his bank statement from the bank on Friday,” she confirms.  The
62-year-old has been working at Ford
South Africa and has been described as a “very humble, sociable and loving
person”.  He recently paid lobola for his
partner after his first wife died in 2011.  “His fiancée is devasted, just as
the rest of the family,” Tebogo tells us.  “We went to hospitals and government
mortuaries to look for him this past weekend. We’re praying for his safe
return.”  The police believe the man may have
been abducted and forced to withdraw cash. Extra sources: Pretoria East
