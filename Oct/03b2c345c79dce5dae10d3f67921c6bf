Police are on the hunt for three suspected "Rolex gang" members after a shootout and hijacking in Sandton on Thursday. "Preliminary investigations reveal that the driver of a black Mercedes-Benz was forced to stop his car after a black Ford Fiesta drove into his car," police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said in a statement. Once the Mercedes-Benz had come to a halt, the three assailants robbed the driver of his Rolex watch.

A shootout between the driver and the suspects ensued, forcing the three men to flee the scene. "The suspects managed to hijack a VW Polo, which was later found abandoned a few kilometres from the scene," Makhubele said. There were no injuries or fatalities. "We are calling on anyone with information to come forward," Makhubele urged.
