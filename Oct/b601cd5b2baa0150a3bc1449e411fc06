News24 has decided to give our masthead some (Springbok) horns and go green as we put our support firmly behind the team ahead of Saturday's Rugby World Cup final. As part of the countdown to the Boks taking on England in Yokohama, Japan, on Saturday, the News24 logo on our homepage will change to green this week, and feature the Springbok on its masthead. While England booked their berth in the final last Saturday, courtesy of a rousing 19-7 disposal of defending champions New Zealand, Rassie Erasmus' charges had to wait until Sunday to confirm theirs by nosing out Wales 19-16, according to Sport24. News24's editor-in-chief, Adriaan Basson, said the news site was fully behind the Springboks, with the nation also wanting the captain to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for the third time since the dawn of democracy. The Springboks won the trophy in 1995 and 2007. "We are 100% behind the Boks and this is our way of showing captain Siya Kolisi and his team that South Africa is united in our support for them on Saturday," said Basson. "Sport has the magical ability to unite a country and this final couldn't have come at a better time for South Africa. We fully subscribe to the Springboks' slogan that we are #StrongerTogether and will support Siya and the boys to the end," Basson said. The match is expected to kick off at 11:00 on Saturday and of course Sport24 will be bringing you the latest on the coverage in the lead-up to the game as well as on the day.
