I disagree
with Adriaan Basson on sending Eben Etzebeth back from the Rugby World Cup now. If case law is an acceptable
guide, and it is, even though equality issues seem to be a little unequal in
the handling of emotive issues, then I must cite a recent case. Public
Protector v President Ramaphosa contested that the president discipline Pravin Gordhan preemptively, despite a pending legal challenge to her findings in PP v
Gordhan. The court ruled that to do so when the second case might exonerate
Gordhan, would be to impose what could not subsequently be reversed, making it
prejudicial. Part of the problem for Etzebeth, as Parliament advised, is that
his case was badly managed from the outset. Yet you propose that he give up a
once in a lifetime chance to play out a World Cup that he has spent years
preparing for, and you also propose to prejudice his team, on the assumption of
guilty until proven innocent just so that people who have jumped the gun by
attaching a claim value to the incident can enjoy the benefit of the doubt in
a case yet to be heard. And you propose that knowing that if he is found
innocent, such preemptive actions cannot subsequently be reversed. No, the law
is even-handed for all. That is our constitutional right, a right that showed
equivalent restraint on a number of other cases, notably the one relating to
the BLF.
