The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) has spoken out against an apparent attack on one of its members, following the release of a video of man wrestling a JMPD officer to the ground. The video, shared by Yusuf Abramjee on Twitter on Friday, shows a man and a JMPD officer involved in an altercation in front of a stationary taxi, alongside a road. The two men struggle before the officer is pushed to the ground. Bystanders are seen filming the men struggling and expressing shock, but no one intervenes. The officer's firearm remains in his holster during the footage. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says the department was aware of the video, but has no information on when, where or why the incident took place and no complainant has come forward.
