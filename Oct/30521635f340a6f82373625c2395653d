A case of culpable homicide is being investigated by the Botshabelo police after two men died and six people were injured an accident on the N8. The accident, involving a white Toyota Sprinter, a grey Hyundai and a white Toyota Hilux Super Cab of Molly’s Funeral Parlour, occurred on 27 September at about 10:30. Col. Thandi Mbambo, provincial police spokesperson, said the Toyota Hilux collided with the Hyundai, which was being towed by the Toyota Sprinter about 20 km from Botshabelo near Sannaspos. She said Modibedi Maine, the owner and driver of the Toyota Hilux, was admitted to a hospital and was in a stable condition. Motsamai Kenneth Tau and Thato Mathutha, occupants of the Hyundai, died in the accident. Mathutha was behind the wheel of the Hyundai. The occupants of the Toyota Sprinter, Mangaliso July, Poloko Molahloe, Mathulo Mokgadi and Selwane Khusela escaped with minor injuries. Thato Matsietseng, a third occupant of the Hyundai, is still in hospital with two broken legs. Tau reportedly died on impact, while Mathutha died in the Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein the next day. It emerged that Mathutha was first transported to the Botshabelo Hospital, but was later the same day transported to the Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein where the doctor who examined him discovered that he has sustained severe head injuries. He was allegedly declared brain dead. Matsietseng regards himself extremely lucky to be alive after escaping from the wrecked Hyundai. The Hyundai was being towed by the Toyota Sprinter going in the direction of Botshabelo, after stalling on the road due to a technical problem. It is alleged that Maine’s vehicle crashed into the two vehicles from behind. The police investigation is still ongoing.
