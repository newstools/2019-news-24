Eish, you guys reached your pinnacle in the last local government elections.
There was no higher you could climb without more black voters. Mmusi Maimane knew that and needed to do what had to be done to get it. Did you make him leader as a
façade or did you really want him to grow the vote in black communities?
Communities who were slowly starting to believe that the DA might just be that
party for all, that could actually deliver – something they were also starting
to see and believe the ANC cannot do. So you lost a few hundred thousand right wing voters to the FF+ in the
last election ... so what? Good riddance! That was giving you the credit to
grow the black vote going forward – on a plate. You needed to play on that, in
order to convince even more black voters that you are not a white party, but a
centre party for all. Your chances of growing in that area never looked better
– if you handled it right. Instead, you would prefer to lose your credit among black people in order
to win those white voters back - why? Now you have chased most of your black
voters back to the ANC or to the EFF – well done! Never mind shooting yourself in the foot – you just shot yourself in the
head. I predict that you will lose even more votes in the next election, than
you lost in the last. You've certainly lost mine. Sean Beukes Roseban
