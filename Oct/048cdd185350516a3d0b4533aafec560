The skeletal remains of a German man and his dog have been
found in his flat in Senden, western Germany, eight years after he was reported
missing. The decomposed body of Heinz H was discovered in his
apartment after a fire broke out in his flat. His dog was found lying next to
him and it’s believed the dog starved to death after Heinz’s passing. Residents of the flat were forced to evacuate the building after
a fire broke out in the rubbish room in the cellar of the building two weeks
ago. Rescue workers then had to account for the inhabitants in
the block of flats. When they broke into Heinz’s apartment they found the
skeleton of the 59-year-old man and his dog. Angelika Havener, who was Heinz’s neighbour and claimed to
be good friends with him, revealed that she reported him missing to police but
accused them of not following up on her suspicions and not checking up on him
in his flat. But another neighbour reportedly told the police that Heinz
was with a friend in Münster, and the case was shelved. “He was a nice guy, a bit of a loner . . . He told me he
left his job as a baker as he had an allergy to flour dust,” she Angelika. “He didn’t deserve to die the way he did.” His body is being examined and police are investigating the
case.  Sources:
