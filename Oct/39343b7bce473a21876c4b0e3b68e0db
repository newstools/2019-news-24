Police are on the hunt for a group men who robbed a Chicken Licken franchise in Brakpan, east of Johannesburg, last week. "It is alleged that the store manager and cashiers were preparing to close, when they were approached by two armed males," police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters told News24 via a statement. In CCTV footage of the incident that has been circulated widely on social media, another three armed men can be seen at the restaurant. The three men then pin the restaurant's security guard to the ground. Peters said the armed suspects instructed the cashier to open the till. However, when they discovered there was no money in the till, they took the manager to back of the restaurant, demanding that they be shown where the money was. "An undisclosed amount of cash was taken," Peters said. The suspects quickly fled the scene in an unknown vehicle. There were no injuries or fatalities. No arrests have yet been made.
