A
massive search is on for Southern Cape mum Heidi Scheepers and her two children
who vanished after they were last seen in Herolds Bay, near George, on Tuesday. "Nobody has been
found," police spokesperson Malcolm Pojie told News24 by phone, in between
briefing rescue workers. Concern is mounting for the three
who were last seen with a charcoal VW Caravelle, registration number CAW 66036,
according to the Pink Ladies organisation, which circulates information on
missing people. A picture of a fresh-faced and
smiling Heidi, who has mid-length blonde hair was posted in the hope that
people would report sightings. Netwerk24 reported that she went to the beach
on Tuesday with her husband Etienne and their children, Cuzette, 6, and Hugo,
2. They parted ways in the parking
lot with the understanding that they would meet at home later. The alarm was raised by her husband
when his family did not return. The 35-year-old mother had not
taken her cellphone with her. Pojie told the
publication that parts of a vehicle were found near Voëlklip, but they were
still trying to establish whether they were part of her vehicle.   Herolds
Bay is a seaside town along the Garden Route. The George Herald reported that the search resumed
in Voëlklip from first light on Thursday. The publication reported that
parts of the vehicle were found at the foot of a cliff going down to the sea.
Divers had to hold off their search in the water on Wednesday night, due to unfavourable
weather conditions. A broken windscreen of a
Volkswagen vehicle, a shoe and other clothing were seen floating just below
Voëlklip in the sea. TimesLive reported that
the couple owns the Herolds Bay Café and runs the Garden Route Property
Management group, which manages several holiday homes in the area.
