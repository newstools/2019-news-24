“At this
point, there’s not much clarity about many aspects,” Ettienne Scheepers said a
few hours after the body of his two-year-old son, Hugo, was found at Voëlklip
near George. “My wife
and daughter haven’t been found yet,” Ettienne (36) adds. He doesn’t
wish to say any more than that to the media at this time. House wife,
Heidi Scheepers (35), was last seen driving past the Herolds Bay convenience
store, which Ettienne owns. She had Hugo and their daughter, Cuzette (6), who
has Downs syndrome, in the vehicle with her. Captain
Malcolm Pojie, police spokesman, confirmed late on Thursday afternoon that the
body of a toddler was found near the wreckage of the vehicle on the rocks at
Voëlklip. The wreckage is thought to be that of the Scheepers family’s
Volkswagen Caravelle. “Police
divers resumed their search this morning at first, moving down the coast from
Mossel Bay to Wildernis,” Pojie told YOU. Rumours had
been doing the rounds that Heidi and her two children were last seen on the
beach at Herolds Bay. They never returned home. A broken
windshield and inside panel of a car door was found new Voëlklip, near Herolds
Bay, on Wednesday. Police weren’t able to confirm at the time that the wreckage
belonged to the Caravelle.  One
Thursday morning the road to Voëlklip was still closed to traffic and police
were manning the entrance, Netwerk24 reports. Scheepers
reportedly hadn’t taken her cellphone with her, nor any extra items such as
bottles for the children. YOU called
her cellphone. It’s ringing but no one answered.
