An explicit video of a nude woman on a bed has been loaded on to a well-known, free pornographic website citing the name of Fiona Viotti, 30, the Bishops Diocesan College water polo coach who resigned last week amid allegations of a sexual affair with a matric pupil. Various explicit videos and pictures of a woman many claim to be Viotti have been doing the rounds on social media and WhatsApp since the story broke last week. News24 has not been able to independently verify whether the woman in the visual material is indeed Viotti. On Thursday, William Booth, Viotti's attorney, told News24 he would be taking steps to have the video removed from the website as it was posted without her permission. Booth added that any private messages, photos or videos sent by one person to another could not be distributed without the sender's approval. Viotti reportedly left Bishops with immediate effect last week. The school reportedly appointed an attorney to investigate what the principal described as "serious misconduct".

Weekend Argus reported that the pupil had tried to break off the relationship. According to a source, Viotti reportedly sent threatening WhatsApp messages to the learner.
