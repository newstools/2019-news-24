A 35-year-old woman has been arrested after her ex-boyfriend’s girlfriend collapsed after eating yoghurt that the woman had allegedly poisoned in Naledi, Soweto last week. According to Protea Glen SAPS spokesperson, Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng, the woman allegedly entered the man’s backroom when he was not around, put poison inside a yoghurt container she had found in the fridge and then put the yoghurt back in the fridge and left. “The woman still had the keys of the backroom since they were living together when they were still together. Unfortunately, when the man came home, he had no idea that his ex-girlfriend had been to the room and came home with his new girlfriend who helped herself to the yoghurt and collapsed shortly afterwards,” he told DRUM. The girlfriend was then rushed to the hospital and given treatment. “After the woman collapsed, the man’s landlord alerted the man that his ex-girlfriend had been around earlier and said she could have done something. The man then decided to call his ex-girlfriend and when she answered the phone, she allegedly said she was surprised that the man was still breathing since she had put poison in his yoghurt,” Mashiteng continued. The ex-girlfriend was then reported to the police, tracked down and arrested. She faces charges of attempted murder and is due to appear in court soon.
