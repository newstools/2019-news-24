A bridegroom was
arrested the day before his wedding after he allegedly robbed a bank to pay for
his fiancée’s ring and the wedding venue. Heath Bumpous
(36), from Texas, US, walked into the Citizens State Bank on Friday morning and
demanded money, telling the cashier he was armed, NBC
news reports. He fled with the
stolen money before police arrived, iHeart
Radio reports. Local
authorities released surveillance video taken from the bank in the hopes that
the public could help identify him. Heath’s fiancée
saw the footage on Facebook and immediately called him to convince him to turn
himself in, PEOPLE
reports. According to
Trinity County Sheriff Woody Wallace, Heath gave a full confession by Friday
night. “He basically stated he was getting married the next
day, he didn’t have enough money for the wedding ring he wanted to buy and he
needed to pay for the wedding venue,” the sheriff explained. Most of the stolen money has been recovered and the police
thanked Heath’s fiancée for her help in
turning him in. The 36-year-old
has now been charged with robbery. Sources: NBC
