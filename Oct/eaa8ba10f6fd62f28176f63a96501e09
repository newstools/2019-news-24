In 2016 MSF did a household survey in Rustenburg in which they found that one out of every four women had been raped. They also found that onlyÂ 5% of these women reported their rape to a healthcare professional, largely due to the long distances they have to walk in order to get help. The MSF Drivers for Change project is an all-male team who transport victims of sexual abuse to healthcare facilities where they receive the care they need.
