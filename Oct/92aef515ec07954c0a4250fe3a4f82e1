Eastern Cape traffic officers had their hands full when they tried to chase a naked man running on the N2 just outside Port Elizabeth last week. In a video recorded by a passing motorist, the man can be seen jogging down the middle of the road while police try to catch him. The provincial roads and transport spokesperson, Unathi Binqose, said the man was mentally ill and disturbed traffic on the busy highway. "We were compelled to arrest him as he was a danger to himself and motorists," said Binqose. Binqose told News24 that the man was first taken to Kinkelbos police station and later transferred to a nearby mental hospital. "He will remain there until his relatives are found." Bingose said he could not confirm the exact date of the incident.
