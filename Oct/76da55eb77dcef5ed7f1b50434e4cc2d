Two of the Amy'Leigh de Jager kidnapping accused, suspended Laerskool Kollegepark Grade RR teacher Tharina Human and Pieter van Zyl, were denied bail in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate's Court on Friday.   Human broke down after Magistrate Hussain Khota delivered the judgment. She was reportedly a close friend of the De Jager family. A third accused, Laetitia Nel, was released on bail of R25 000 on condition that she reports to the Vanderbijlpark police station every Wednesday and hands over her travel documents. She has also been barred from contacting or communicating with witnesses. A fourth accused, Bofokeng Molemohi, has abandoned his bail application.   Amy'Leigh was snatched from her mother, Angeline, outside Laerskool Kollegepark in Vanderbijlpark on September 2.   Khota postponed the case to November 13 for the matter to be transferred to the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg.
