Two armed suspects overpowered a security guard at an Engen garage in Lenasia, Johannesburg, on Wednesday and made off with an undisclosed amount of money. The incident happened at around 19:30 at the garage on the corner of Flamingo Street and Nirvana Drive. Police spokesperson Sergeant Khalipha Mvula told News24 the suspects disarmed the guard and took his firearm. "They then went inside the garage and held up the female cashier," he said. "They ordered her to open the cash register." Mvula added the assailants made off with an undisclosed amount of money and fled the scene in a white Honda Ballade. "No shots were fired during the robbery and no one was injured," he said. The police have opened a case of business robbery. Essop Adam, a manager at the garage, said "everyone is fine". He added the store was not busy at the time of the incident, saying no one was injured. According to Essop, the men fled with between R3 000 and R4 000.
