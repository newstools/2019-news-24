Almost five months after an ill 76-year-old Martha Marais made headlines after she was tied to a Mamelodi Hospital bench, an out-of-court settlement with the Gauteng health department has been reached. Department spokesperson Philani Mhlungu confirmed that a mediation process the department entered into with the family to try to resolve the matter outside of court was concluded. "The parties have reached a settlement and the matter has been finalised," Mhlungu said, adding that he could not disclose further details. The mediation, which started on September 20, was chaired by a retired judge.

When the family found her, she was hungry and dehydrated. At the time, family spokesperson Virginia Keppler said Marais was not a violent person and in the event that she had had a psychotic episode, she was so old and fragile that she couldn't do any harm. She added that Marais was heavily traumatised: "She keeps on repeating herself about what happened to her and how she was tied up..." In June, they said they would be pursuing civil litigation. The SA Human Rights Commission also said it would seek redress for the victim and compensation. Investigation Newly appointed Gauteng Health MEC, Dr Bandile Masuku, and Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize also intervened and an investigation was carried out. In June, four staffers who had been implicated in the incident were put on special leave as the investigation continued.

"This matter is still pending and once the implicated staff members have responded to the charges brought against them, the department will determine the way forward as well as the cause of action to be implemented," Mhlungu said.

"We want people to go to jail, someone must take responsibility, there [are] people being identified. The MEC has indicated that as the investigations develop, there might be more people implicated...," Keppler told News24 at the time.
