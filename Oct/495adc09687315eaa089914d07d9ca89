As the Springboks prepare for the Rugby World Cup final in Japan, some 15 000km back in Cape Town, a group of fitness and rugby-mad fanatics trekked to the top of Lion's Head to wish the national team well. The final, which kicks off at 11:00 local time on Saturday, is a repeat of the 2007 final when the Boks edged England 15-6 to hoist the Webb Ellis Cup for the second time, with the first being the historic 1995 win. Sports journalists and people in general have looked to the 12-year gap between the two World Cup finals wins as a good omen for coach Rassie Erasmus and his team. The message was clear from the hikers: "Go Bokke." Joining the hiking party on Wednesday was a man who knows a thing or two about winning a final - 2007 fullback Percy Montgomery. "We're on Lion's Head in Cape Town. We just want to wish the Boks well for the World Cup final … go Bokke," read Montgomery's message. Springbok captain Siya Kolisi will lead the side out in what will be his 50th Test match.  SEE: Pictures from Wednesday afternoon’s hike up Lion’s Head in Cape Town.
