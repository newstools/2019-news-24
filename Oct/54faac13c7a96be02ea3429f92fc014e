University
of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) students assaulted a male student on Monday at its
Westville campus after he allegedly trespassed on a female residence block on
campus. The suspect allegedly entered a bathroom where a female student was
taking a shower at around 12pm on Monday. When she
noticed the man, the female student screamed, and he was soon removed from the
building by UKZN Risk Management Services (RMS). As the alleged trespasser was
escorted out of the building, a group of angry students approached and attacked
him. The student
claims he had merely entered the bathroom to use the toilet. It is believed he
entered the block through a fire escape. 
The Daily News reports they have seen a video of the student being
punched, kicked and hit with sticks as UKZN officials tried to escort him. UKZN
spokesperson Ashton Bodrick tells DRUM the student has been arrested and that
it is unacceptable for a male student to enter a female student residence or
bathroom. The university’s management will not tolerate such misdemeanours. WATCH: Unrest as students and security clash at UKZN Students, police and security personnel at the University of KwaZulu-Natal clashed on Tuesday morning ringing out another day of violence at two of its campuses. “Students
who flout the university rules and commit acts which threaten the safety of
other students, most especially female students, will be severely dealt with by
management. The police and university RMS are investigating the matter and the
police have opened a case on a trespassing charge. Counselling services have
been arranged for the female student.” UKZN
Student Representative Council Westville chair Moses Nkambako says the students
are still living in fear.
