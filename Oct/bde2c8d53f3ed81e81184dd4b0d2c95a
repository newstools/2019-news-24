Two elderly women were found murdered in a retirement centre in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape, police said on Thursday morning. Spokesperson Priscilla Naidu said staff found the women at about 05:45 in their separate rooms at the St John Stella Londt Centre. They also found signs of a robbery at the centre in Sunridge Park. Ninety-one-year-old Agnes Burns was found first. "She was found on the bed with her feet and hands tied and her mouth gagged. The room was ransacked," said Naidu. The attackers then moved to the room of 87-year-old Rosemary Langton. "She too was found with hands and feet tied and mouth gagged. Her room was also ransacked." The centre's CEO George Woods said staff and residents were devastated.

He knew the women personally from visits to the centre. The company intend to put whatever they can into helping the police with their investigation. "Our staff are devastated. We are devastated," said Woods. "My thoughts and prayers go out to their families." The centre is a subsidiary of the well-known NGO St Johns. A chaplain was sent to the centre on Thursday and a trauma counsellor would also be sent out. The centre has also done a perimeter check and asked their security company to do another assessment for advice on further safety measures.
