An SABC news crew covering protests over the closing of the Mamusa municipality in the North West province were assaulted and robbed of equipment in Schweizer-Reneke on Monday. According to the national broadcaster, the crew was approached by a group who accused them of being "biased" in their reporting. SABC reporter Zebilon Maine reportedly said: "A group of people came into [the] guesthouse where we were working at and they started to cause a fracas." A cameraman was reportedly physically assaulted, while others were verbally abused. Reporter Sellwane Khakhau said the three men who attacked them were unhappy that the crew did not interview certain individuals they felt should have been spoken to. They were also upset that an ANC official had been interviewed. Khakhau said the ANC was interviewed because it was in charge of the municipalities in the area.

The office of the chief whip of the ANC in the North West legislature said it was "dismayed by the unfortunate incident". "This unfortunate incident constitutes the attack of the highest order on the freedom of the press and must be met with the full might of the law," it said in a statement.
