Residents of a house that was flooded with sewage claim they had to pay out of their own pockets in order to get the City of Cape Town to fix the problem. Zolile Magoqoza, of NY 43, said the problem started on Monday 23 September. A drain in their backyard started to leak and things got worse the next day (Heritage Day). On Wednesday they visited the Fezeka municipal office to report the problem and they were promised some help. However, help never arrived until Magoqoza met a council truck in the area on Friday 27 September and asked the workers to help. He claimed they demanded that he gave them “cash for a drink”. He said he gave them the money and they fixed the drain. He said he had no choice but to pay in order to get help because the smell was unbearable and their lives were at risk. Magoqoza’s wife Rose said she felt sick from the smell because they were trying to drain the water by using buckets. She said the problem is that the drain overflows because it is shared with other households. “The apartheid government built this drainage systems and no one has ever changed it. It is not the first time that this is happening,” she said. The City’s spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo said the “old drainage systems” in Gugulethu have been sufficiently designed to deal with the capacity of the discharge from the number of properties they serve, however, it is not designed to handle foreign objects such as rags and rubble or fats and sand among other things. “This causes more than 95% of the overflows in Gugulethu. He said City officials are not allowed to solicit money or bribes from residents, and some have been dismissed for similar offences. “If residents can provide any information that could help us identify these residents we will ensure appropriate action is taken,” he added.
