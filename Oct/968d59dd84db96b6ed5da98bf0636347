A 34-year-old suspect who was arrested last week for allegedly raping a two-year-old girl in Reiger Park, Johannesburg, has been released due to a lack of evidence, EWN reported on Tuesday. The girl's family and community members reportedly waited for hours at the Boksburg Magistrate's Court on Monday, where the man was expected to appear. When he did, prosecutors reportedly told the court that the matter would not be placed on the roll. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane told News24 the matter was not placed on the roll, pending further investigations. Once the investigations are completed, the docket will reportedly be brought back to the NPA for a decision.
