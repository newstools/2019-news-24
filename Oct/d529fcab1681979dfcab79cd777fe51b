A man sent heart-rending images of himself after he faked
his own kidnapping. The man who’s since been identified as Mr Huang from the
town of Sanxiang South China’s Guangdong Province, was reported missing by his
wife, Ms Huang, after she contacted the local police station. This came after she received messages from his purported
kidnappers sent from her husband’s phone. “Are you [Huang’s] wife? He still owes us 20 000 RMB (about
R42 000). Bring it to us, or you’ll never see him again,” the text message
read. Ms Huang said she was concerned about her husband’s
wellbeing but didn’t immediately pay the ransom, believing it could be a scam. In screenshots of the conversation, the distressed wife asks:
“Let me see him and I’ll pay you. If I can’t see him, how do I know whether
he’s dead or alive?” She waited two full days until more messages arrived, this
time accompanied by images appearing to show Mr Huang’s hands and feet bound,
and his mouth gagged. But after intensive investigating, authorities found that the
man’s kidnapping was a hoax and he had, in fact, stayed at a hotel when he was
supposedly kidnapped. CCTV images also showed the man walking freely and not
being held against his will. When police finally tracked Mr Haung down, he confessed to
deceiving his wife so she’d send him money to pay off debt. The man was sentenced to 10 days in prison and fined 500
RMB (about R1 000) for a public order offense. Source:
