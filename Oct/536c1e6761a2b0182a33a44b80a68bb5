This week on POLOTIKI, the DA's internal politics are in the spotlight again. The position of the DA's federal council chairperson is currently a hot topic after former leader and Western Cape premier Helen Zille announced that she would contest the position alongside Athol Trollip, Mike Waters and Thomas Walters. The new chairperson will be elected at a meeting of the federal council at the end of the month. Zille spoke exclusively to News24's senior political journalist Tshidi Madia about the motivating factors behind her return to politics and her plans for the DA. News24 politics reporter Lizeka Tandwa also joins Madia to discuss Zille's never-say-die attitude. Will Zille's resurgence bring stability to the party after its poor showing at the 2019 national elections? Another hot topic is the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal. The party has started to prepare for the much-anticipated eThekwini regional conference where ousted eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede is expected to contest the position of regional ANC chairperson. She dominated the headlines this week after the Hawks and Asset Forfeiture Unit swooped in on the Umhlanga homes of her and her co-accused on Thursday. They have been charged with fraud and corruption relating to a municipal solid waste tender worth more than R200m. In the raid, assets worth more than R50m were seized from the various accused, News24 reported. Gumede continues to protest her innocence,Â saying she does not own luxury cars. Will Gumede's current legal troubles continue to cast a cloud on her leadership capabilities ahead of the eThekwini regional conference? Or will this push her supporters to rev up their efforts to get her back in office? Once you have listened, share the podcast and your thoughts on our social media platforms.
