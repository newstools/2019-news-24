Three men have survived a helicopter crash in a street in Sinoville, Pretoria, on Friday afternoon, paramedics say. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics found the chopper on its side in Marija Street, with three men found nearby. "Fortunately, all three men escaped serious injury and declined transportation to a nearby hospital," said Meiring. Local authorities and fire services closed the road off for medics to assess the three men. The helicopter lay metres away from a wall and housing.
