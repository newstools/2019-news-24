Gauteng Economic Development Agriculture and Environment Kgosientso Ramokgopa has resigned from Premier David Makhura's provincial cabinet.     Makhura, in a messageÂ  on Twitter, announced that he would be replaced by Morakane Mosupyoe. Mosupyoe, who also comes from Tshwane, was council speaker when Ramokgopa was mayor. In a statement the economic development department released, Ramakgopa expressed his "most sincere gratitude" to the ANC for his deployment to the provincial legislature. He also thanked Makhura. "It has been a great pleasure to serve the people of Gauteng and I have no doubt that the 6th administration will take the province forward by remaining focused on the task at hand of growing an inclusive and transformed economy that creates jobs for the unemployed," his statement read. The ANC national executive committee (NEC) decided that in provinces where there are male premiers, 60% of the executive had to be female. Makhura, however, had 50/50 representation. This led the party leadership in the province, also headed by Makhura, to hold countless meetings with numerous leagues and structures to retain the status quo.       News24 earlier reported that ANC insiders had suggested Ramokgopa could be deployed to the national government where there is a vacancy in the Department of Minerals and Energy, following the death of deputy minister Bavelile Hlongwa. Ironically, this move could see Ramokgopa once again caught up in a debate about gender parity, this time at a national level.
