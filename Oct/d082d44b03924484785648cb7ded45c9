A woman visiting
the Bronx Zoo in New York over the weekend risked her life when she climbed
into a lion enclosure to taunt the animal. A video of the
reckless act was posted on Instagram. The woman can be seen dancing and waving
her hands in front of the large male lion, CBS
news reports. Other zoo-goers
can be heard in the background questioning her actions, PEOPLE
reports. According to a
statement released by the zoo, staff members were alerted to the news that
someone had climbed over the safety barrier at the African Lion Exhibit on
Saturday. “This action was a serious violation and unlawful
trespass that could’ve resulted in serious injury or death,” the statement read. “Barriers and rules are in place to keep both
visitors, staff and animals safe. We have a zero tolerance policy on trespassing
and violation of barriers.” The New York
Police Department is currently investigating a report of criminal trespassing, NBC
news reports. The zoo and lion exhibit remained open after the
incident. I REALLY HAVE NO FEAR OF NOTHING BREATHING?? ??Lioness ??
