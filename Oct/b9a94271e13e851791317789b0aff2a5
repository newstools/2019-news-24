Charges have been provisionally withdrawn against a Moorreesburg pastor following his arrest for allegedly sexually molesting and raping a four-year-old girl. He has also been released. Western Cape National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the matter had not been placed on the court roll as further investigation and consultation was needed. The 49-year-old pastor was first accused of molesting and raping the girl five months ago, according to Netwerk24.
