The Vanguard and Welcome Estate neighbourhood watch held it’s inaugural senior’s event at St Theresa’s School hall, in Welcome, on Saturday 28 September. The programme focused on health and wellness, with a pampering session for seniors. In addition to Melomed paramedics in attendance to check blood pressures and provide general health check-ups of community seniors, manicures and pedicures were offered in addition to facial massages which left the guests feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. Vanguard and Welcome Estate neighbourhood watch chairperson, Naser Ally welcomed everyone and introduced the programme for the day. “The gratitude expressed by our seniors was indeed rewarding,” said Ally. “The day turned out to be great fun with lots to eat and pampering to enjoy.” The ward councillor Anthony Moses was given an opportunity to say a few words and thanked the guests for being able to join in the fun, handing out gifts and invitations to all seniors present to attend another event that was to be hosted by the City of Cape Town. Ally further thanked all the sponsors of the event and all those members of the watch and ratepayers who assisted in making the day a success.
