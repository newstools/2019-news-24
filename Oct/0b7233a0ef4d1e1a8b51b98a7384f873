A Westville prison inmate facing a murder charge, who made a run for it two months ago, was rearrested in Umbilo, KwaZulu-Natal, during the early hours of Monday morning. Ashen Vishnudath, 27, escaped from the prison on August 15 after allegedly using another prisoner's particulars, according to police. It is alleged that he used the details of the fellow inmate, who had the option to pay for bail, so that he would be released instead. "A case of escaping from lawful custody was opened at the Westville police station and the docket was assigned to the provincial Organised Crime Unit for further investigation. Detectives were on his trail since he escaped from custody until this morning (Monday) when he was arrested," police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said. He is expected to appear in the Pinetown Magistrate's Court on Tuesday on a charge of escaping from lawful custody. Meanwhile, two other prisoners, Sudeshan Govender ,34, and Tashlin Israel, 27, were arrested on August 17 for aiding him to escape, Naicker said. A third man was arrested on Friday, October 11, also for his role in the escape and he was charged with defeating the ends of justice. Vishnudath is awaiting trial for a murder that was reported at the Marianhill police station in March this year.
