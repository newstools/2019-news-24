Fake drivers' licences, vehicle licence disks, bank statements, marriage certificates and even asylum documentation were among the items that officers uncovered at a backyard internet and printing cafe in Cape Town, officials said on Friday. Maitland police and traffic officers responded to complaints on Thursday about fraudulent documents produced at a home on the corner of Koeberg and Conway streets in Brooklyn. Traffic services spokesperson Maxine Jordaan said they found a stash of fake documents and R12 000 in cash, and seized computers and "even templates for everything from medical certificates to identity documents, passports and salary slips". Jordaan said it later transpired that an arrest a traffic officer had made the previous day for a fraudulent driver's licence could be linked. "In August, the City's metro police department made a similar bust in Gugulethu," she said. Western Cape police spokesperson Siyabulela Malo said they arrested three men between the ages of 27 and 37. Malo said the men would appear in court soon on charges of forgery and uttering.
