It's been a rollercoaster year for South Africans. We had a national election which saw Cyril Ramaphosa assuming the most powerful position in the country. We watched as Jacob and Duduzane Zuma took center stage at the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture - where their testimonies left the nation with more questions than answers. We had moments of heartbreak and devastation with the frequent reports violence against women, children and migrants. And we found ourselves in the dark after Eskom re-introduced loading shedding. However, despite the dark times we had moments of glory thanks to the Springbok's triumphant World Cup win and Zozibini Tunzi snagging the Miss Universe crown. On this special episode of The Story, we talk to editors and senior reporters in our newsroom, about the stories and newsmakers that dominated 2019.
