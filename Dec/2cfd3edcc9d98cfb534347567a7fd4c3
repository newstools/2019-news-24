The mother of an 18-month-old boy who was almost abducted from a supermarket in Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal, has told News24 she is being plagued by questions of "what if?" ever since the incident happened. "My mind has literally been all over the place with thoughts of what if?" she said. The woman asked not the be named to protect the identity of her son. She opened a case of kidnapping with the police and a 29-year old security guard has since been arrested for allegedly snatching the boy who was out shopping with his grandmother. The incident, which happened last Thursday, was caught on CCTV camera. The footage has been widely circulated online. It shows the boy sitting in a shopping trolley next to his grandmother, who is paying her groceries bill. A security guard casually walks up to the boy and picks him up out of the trolley. He then makes his way to the exit and heads towards another store. The woman becomes frantic when she realises her grandson is missing. "She [the grandmother] ran through the mall screaming his name," said provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker in a statement. "She then spotted the man attired in a security guard uniform walking into one of the shops with her grandson," added Naicker. The video footage shows the woman grabbing the child from the man's arms. "I don't know who leaked the footage, but I wouldn't have wanted it on social media," the boy's mother told News24. She said some of the comments have been upsetting. Although her son is doing fine after the ordeal,Â she said her mother was still traumatised by what had happened. "My mom doesn't even want to leave the house, she doesn't want to be in the shops at the moment," the woman said. She told News24 seeing the CCTV footage of the incident had left her fuming. "I thought, how could this man pick up my child without any consent or without asking." "I don't know what his intentions were with my son. I just hope that justice will be served. That's all."
