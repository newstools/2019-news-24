A dearly beloved pooch died in his owners’ arms after
suffering a panic attack. Magui, who belonged to Antonella Modasjazh from Esquel in
the south of Argentina, couldn’t cope with noisy fireworks going off near her
home and suffered a panic attack. Taking to her Facebook page, Antonella shared the
heartbreaking final moments captured of Magui in her son’s arms, in a post
which has since been shared more than 12 000 times. She confirmed that the dog was old and scared of the noise
created by the fireworks. Despite calling available vets to help her pet as it
suffered a panic attack nobody responded. “Your fun terrified her, it generated an inexplicable
panic. Your fun killed her,” Antonella wrote in her post. “Magui died in the arms of her owner. Her family was left
in a bad situation in the face of unfair things. This family lost a member of
the family.” Sources:
