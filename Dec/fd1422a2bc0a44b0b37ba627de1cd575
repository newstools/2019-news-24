There were no Christmas cheer for Lotto players on Wednesday with no draws taking place. Operator Ithuba quietly made the announcement on social media on Tuesday that there would be no Lotto draws on Wednesday, December 25. Lotto, Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2 draws usually air at 20H57 on SABC, followed by the Daily Lotto results announcement on Twitter. Ithuba noted that normal draws will resume on Thursday, 26, which is the Day of Goodwill public holiday. Meanwhile, Lotto enthusiasts took to social media to query what would happen to their tickets which were purchased online. Sol Bokwe (@Bokwe_) tweeted a picture of a notification of his Lotto purchase. It displayed Wednesday's date of "2019-12-25". Another twitter user by the name generic_tourner (@ertos_) replied that he played R50 via the banking app. "[A]re we just donating that money to guys now", he asked. Ronny Sambo posted on Facebook that he bought a ticket through his online banking account."I've noticed that you said [there will] be no draw for ... 25th December. "Are we going to be refunded or what? I've spent and bought the tickets." The lottery operator did not respond to any of the questions posed by the players. Ithuba was also not available for comment when reached out by News24. According to Ithuba, over R2.5bn has been won across all the games in 2019, with the biggest jackpot ever to be paid in the history of the lottery in South Africa, and Africa at large, being the R232m PowerBall jackpot that was won by a blue-collar worker from Cape Town after 24 rollovers, reported News24 in November. Other notable big jackpots came from PowerBall and PowerBall PLUS games, with a R141m win on August 23 2019 and R70m on September 3.
