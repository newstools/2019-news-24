The youngster was reported missing when he failed to return
home after visiting his father in Spain. Angelo Jurado-Marmolejo from Bristol in the UK, who was
reported missing by his mother in March, has finally been returned home after
allegedly being kidnapped by his father, Rafael Jurado-Cabello. The eight-year-old was last seen by his mother, Karol Marmolejo, when
he went to visit his father in Spain but didn’t return home as the parents, who
are no longer together, had agreed upon. After becoming frustrated, the concerned mom staged
protests about the situation in the UK, Spain and Colombia, where she is from. UK police say Angelo was recovered by
Spanish authorities at Madrid airport on Saturday after getting off a flight
from Mexico with his father. According to local reports, court documents reveal that
Rafael Jurado-Cabello is being investigated. Little Angelo has since been returned to his mother, while
his father’s location is unknown. Sources:
