EFF leader Julius Malema told journalists on Sunday that his party won't be passing a motion of no confidence in President Cyril Ramaphosa, but would instead take to the streets in defence of state-owned enterprises. Malema accused Ramaphosa and his "cabal" of wanting to sell the SOEs to white monopoly capital, during a media briefing by the EFF's top 6 at the party's second elective conference in Nasrec. Malema, who was reelected unopposed, promised that 2020 would be a year of action. "No one is going to sell Eskom under our watch," he said.
