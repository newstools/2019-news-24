Donations for funeral arrangements have poured in since the death of the boy. Lavender Hill activist Lucinda Evans, who is also the director of non-profit organisation Philisa Abafazi Bethu, told News24 earlier this week that the organisation had contributed 100% towards the funeral costs. Other donations received were used to renovate the family's home and pay for transport that will be used during the funeral. The funeral service will be held at Levana Primary School and Valentino will be buried at Plumstead Cemetery.
