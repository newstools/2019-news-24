Victoria
– A French tourist was seriously injured after being attacked by a shark while
swimming in the Seychelles, a popular tourist destination, the French
ambassador said on Monday. The attack on the 45-year-old
woman took place on Sunday night, off the island of Praslin, the second-largest
in the picturesque archipelago famed for its pristine beaches. The victim was injured in one arm
and was transported to a hospital. "She underwent an operation
last night and her life is not in danger," ambassador Dominique Mas told
AFP. The attack comes during the high
tourist season for the Seychelles, an archipelago of 115 islands located off
the coast of East Africa in the Indian Ocean. Such incidents are rare in the
Seychelles, though two tourists – one French and one British – were killed in
shark attacks off Praslin in August 2011. Coast Guard: Shark bites surfer off Calif. coast A shark reportedly bit a surfer Saturday afternoon off Southern California in a “truly terrifying situation,” the Coast Guard said. A friend applied a tourniquet and the man was hospitalized in stable condition. Officials said Praslin's
relatively cool waters could attract sharks during breeding. The Seychelles Maritime Safety
Administration (SMSA) cordoned off the area where Sunday's attack occurred to
search for the shark. The SMSA also imposed a temporary
ban on swimming in the area.
