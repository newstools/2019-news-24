Water quality results at Bakoven, following a sewage discharge during load shedding, indicate that the water is within the acceptable guidelines for recreational use as stipulated by the Department of Environmental Affairs, IOL reported on Friday. This is according to the City of Cape Town, which confirmed that sewage was released from a pump station close to Bakoven Beach, resulting in signage that warned the water quality had possibly been affected. Describing the spills which may occur during load shedding as an abnormal, temporary situation, mayoral committee member for community services and health Zahid Badroodien told the publication that it should not be inferred that affected beaches were not suited for recreation on a long-term basis as the risk was rapidly mitigated with wave dispersion. Manager in the City of Cape Town's coastal management department, Gregg Oelofse, said the discharge occurred on December 11 and was quickly responded to and remedied in accordance with standard protocol. Precautionary signage was erected until the water samples were tested. The temporary warning was removed on Sunday, the report reads. Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa said sabotage contributed to recent load shedding. While a number of factors were said to have contributed to the recent rotational power cuts, including heavy rains, unplanned outages and the age of power stations, Ramaphosa said about 2 000MW of power were also lost due to an act of sabotage. He said there would likely be no load shedding between December 17 and January 13. - Compiled by Tammy Petersen
