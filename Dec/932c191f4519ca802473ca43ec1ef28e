Dews of Quietness was robbed of thousands of rands worth of goods last month and now the community is rallying to help them replenish their Christmas donation stock. The non-profit organisation specialises in victim empowerment and the creation of safe spaces for women and children. Operating from a refurbished container at Delta Primary School in Steenberg, the NPO has been collecting goods to donate for several months. “It was broken into on 18 November and it was horrible,” says Moeridah Dien, founder of the NPO. “They stole R6 000 worth of toiletries. They stole the gas stove, new pots, a computer, three crates of cutlery, crockery, 150 packs of pads and I don’t even know what else!” She adds: “And we were preparing to do the Santa shoebox drive – and now we’re sitting with nothing. But we’re getting help from all over to make it happen.” Gillian Stoffels, a senior admin clerk at the Steenberg police station, called on residents and colleagues to assist her. “We did it within a month – because I heard her container was broken into and a lot of things were taken. So we just decided, let’s do something for them. It was from individuals at the station and I also had a friend who donated some things,” Stoffels says. The small group were able to collect toiletries, beanies and some books and toys. Dien adds that the goods received at a handover on Tuesday 3 December were not the only donations. “Somebody came and gave us a stove – a two-plate burner and a gas tank – but we didn’t get anything back that was stolen. But that’s not going to put us off.” The police arrested one man for theft but did not have enough evidence to charge him. Dien says they are still waiting on the results of fingerprints found at the scene. Dien says they still plan to distribute Christmas donations next week Friday.V Call Moeridah on 078 4000 801 to make a donation or for more information.
