"It has been confirmed that Staggie was shot and killed this morning in Salt River. This follows the shooting and death of a reported gang member, aged 32 years, in Mitchells Plain yesterday (Thursday).

Fritz called on neighbourhood watches, CPFs and responsible community leaders to play a role in bringing calm. "I have been informed that police forensic experts were on the scene of the shooting incident this morning. Staggie died on arrival at a nearby hospital.
