NELSON Mandela University has entered into a research partnership with the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), which will see the institution being home to a first-of-a- kind collaborative research training hub. The research laboratory will be based at the NMU George Campus and the idea is to develop an understanding of the position and effect of humans in the overall ecosystem, in the way the biosphere works. Also how the natural environment benefits humans. It will be addressed through cross-cutting projects such as how to make multifunctional landscapes sustainable in delivering the ecosystem services humans rely on. Another will be on how to manage livestock farming hand-in-hand with environmental stewardship so that livelihoods and the environment can both flourish. Or how to plan a town around ecological services such as water, how to incorporate biodiversity in livelihoods in the face of climate change and what adaptations are required to cope with environmental risks. â€“ REPORTER
