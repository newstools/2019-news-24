EFF leader Julius Malema says he's happy with the fierce lobbying in the party ahead of its second elective conference, which kicks off on Friday. News24 senior political reporter Tshidi Madia spoke to Malema on a range of topics, including the opportunity to govern, open borders and being prosecuted and convicted in the court of public opinion. Malema is expected to be reelected as leader of South Africa's third-largest party at what the EFF calls its national people's assembly (NPA). Around 4 000 delegates are expected to vote for new party leaders, including its top 6 and central command team, which will form the highest decision-making structureÂ  between conferences.
