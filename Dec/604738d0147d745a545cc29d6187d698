The City ofÂ Ekhuruleni has tweeted that fires affecting the Transnet petrol and gas pipeline in Alberton have been extinguished. Earlier, the blaze resulted in the evacuation of everyone in the area. Transnet said the fire had been caused by attempted theft at the 
petroleum pipeline between Alrode and the airport, resulting in a petrol
 spillage which also caught fire. The pipeline is one of 
Transnet's 3 800km, high-pressure petroleum and gas pipelines which run 
from Durban to Gauteng and is currently being decommissioned. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.
