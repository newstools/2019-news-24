The DA was dealt another blow after Tshwane speaker Katlego Mathebe was removed from council through a motion of no confidence on Thursday evening. The special council meeting meant to deal with the motion against Mathebe got off to a chaotic start after the speaker opened the session and then recused herself. Mathebe's recusal, because the motion involved her, was met with anger from both the ANC and the EFF. Councillors protested because they were not happy with Zweli Khumalo taking over as speaker. At least two scuffles between different parties also broke out as councillors disagreed about who should replace Mathebe as speaker.

He also accused Khumalo of being drunk. A member of the Gauteng Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs then stepped in to facilitate a process to appoint a temporary speaker to hear the motion of no confidence. EFF Tshwane councillor Obakeng Ramabodu was elected by the ANC and the EFF, while the DA did not provide a candidate as it was protesting the illegality of the process. The motion against Mathebe then went to a vote where 110 councillors voted for the motion, while no member of council voted against it. On Wednesday the ANC took back the City of Johannesburg, after Geoff Makhubo was voted in as the new mayor following the resignation of the DA's Herman Mashaba.
