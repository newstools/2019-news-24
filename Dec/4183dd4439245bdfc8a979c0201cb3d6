A fire has killed a 14-year-old girl and destroyed 20
shacks in the Ndulini informal settlement in the Eastern Cape. Witnesses heard the screams of Zintle Manganyan Zabo (14),
who was trapped in a burning shack on Monday afternoon. Attempts were made to
break open the door, but the fire was raging and spread rapidly – eventually
burning surrounding shacks. Captain Andre’ Beetge of the New Brighton police station
said that the girl passed away in the fire and about 20 shacks were destroyed,
leaving more than 100 residents without homes and desperate for help. “The case of the fire is still unknown and as the SAPS we
would like to thank the Nelson Mandela Disaster Management for their emergency
response, as well as the ward councilor of ward 19 for their speedy assistance
with blankets and mattresses, as well as the somalian society in the area who
donated food to people.” “There remains a need for assistance in the form of clothing,
bedding and more food, any person who wishes to help or contribute can contact
the coordinator or visits the New Brighton police station.
