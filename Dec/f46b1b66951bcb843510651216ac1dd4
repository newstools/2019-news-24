Western Cape police are investigating allegations that two small boys were raped by their 13-year-old neighbour in Heideveld, Cape Town. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk confirmed that two rape cases were under investigation but said details could not be divulged due to the "sensitive nature" of the cases. According to the Daily Voice, the mother of one of the victims found her three-year-old son on the bed of the alleged perpetrator on October 31. After discovering that he was wearing another child's underpants, she took her son to a doctor who told her that the child had been raped. There are allegations that another child was also raped, according to the report. The mother reportedly said the the three-year-old child started harming himself and was struggling with the trauma. No arrests have been made, Van Wyk said. - Compiled by Maxine Becket
