What
started off as the end of their academic studies soon turned out to be the
start of the rest of their lives together. When
Eveline Tshibwabwa, a Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) alumni,
took to the stage to collect her internal auditing qualification at her
graduation, she didn’t know that her beau, DieMerci (Diego) Mukeba, was
planning the perfect proposal. “We were
both studying the same course and graduated on the same day,” the 24-year-old
to YOU. “This
entire year had just been so difficult for both of us especially because we
were studying while working. “But he’s
such a caring partner and was so supportive throughout the year.” On 10
December, the day of their graduation at the CPUT Bellville campus, Eve noticed
that Diego who she’s been with since 2016, was acting a bit strange. “He was inexplainably calm, compared to our previous graduation I was more nervous this
time which was quite strange,” she explained After the
ceremony the pair headed outside to take pictures for their memorable day. “We hired a
photographer to capture us and our families on the special day but throughout
the shoot, I started to notice that our classmates and friends were following
us around,” Eve said. Then the
unexpected happened . . . Midway
through their photoshoot, Diego got down on one knee and asked Eve to spend the
rest of her life with him. &lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&gt; “I was
completely speechless, I couldn’t believe it . . . at that moment I was
incredibly overwhelmed with emotions.” While
they’re in no rush to set a date for their wedding, Eve emphasises the
importance of having a supportive partner.
