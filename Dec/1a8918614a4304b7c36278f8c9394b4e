Alleged sex offender Willem Breytenbach has been granted R50 000 bail during his first appearance in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court. Magistrate Ronel Oliver on Thursday granted bail with conditions, which include that Breytenbach signs in at a police station three times a week, and remains in the Groot Brak area. He must also surrender his passport and not have contact with complainants. Breytenbach faces charges of sexual and indecent assault. The first alleged offence took place in 1997. It is expected that more charges will be added. Breytenbach didn't respond to questions posed to him by members of the media outside court.
