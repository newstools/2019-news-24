President Cyril Ramaphosa has said sabotage contributed to the recent uninterrupted load shedding. Ramaphosa briefed the media on the load shedding crisis at Eskomâ€™s Megawatt Park in Sandton on Wednesday after cutting short an official visit to Egypt. The president said while a number of factors contributed to recent rotational power cuts, including heavy rains, unplanned outages and the age of power stations, about 2 000MW of power were also lost due to an act of sabotage.
