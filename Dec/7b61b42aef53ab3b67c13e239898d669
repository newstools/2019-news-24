The alleged sex offender Willem Breytenbach - who has been accused of rape by Johannesburg-based copywriter Deon Wiggett - arrived at the Cape Town Central police station on Tuesday evening. He was arrested just after midday at his psychologist's practice in Hartenbos, close to Mossel Bay, in the Southern Cape. Breytenbach was first taken to the Da Gamaskop child protection unit in Mossel Bay for processing and later transported to the Cape Town Central police station. He will be held here until he appears in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Wednesday or Thursday.
