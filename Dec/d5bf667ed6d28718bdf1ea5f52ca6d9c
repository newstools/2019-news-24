While police have not said whether the spate of murders was the work of a serial killer, they have called the killer the "nocturnal prowler". They're on the hunt for a suspect... before more bodies turn up.  Although little information was released, the police said all the victims were homeless, middle-aged men and all of them were murdered at night, presumably while they were asleep. News24 also previously reported that autopsy results revealed that all five men died after they were stabbed multiple times. No more murders of homeless men reported While not much more is known about the killings, Gauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters told News24 that there haven't been any reports of murders of homeless men since the fifth body was discovered in June. There have also been no arrests or linkages. Almost seven months ago, Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela instructed a high-level task team, comprising forensics specialists, pathologists, criminal psychologists, Crime Intelligence officers and detectives to prioritise the investigation.

Survivors News24 previously reported that a homeless man who had been attacked said he lived in constant fear that his attacker would return to finish the job. The man, who declined to reveal his identity to News24, used to live in Magnolia Park in Muckleneuk - the same park where the bodies of two homeless men were found. He previously told News24 that he awoke early one morning in May to a man violently stabbing him multiple times.

Identifying the victims By the end of June, three of the victims had been positively identified. By August, two had been buried after the police managed to trace their families. At the time, Peters said the police were still trying to locate the third victim's next of kin.

Suspect arrested for attempted murder of homeless men Meanwhile, in a case that has not been linked to the murders, a man, who is accused of stabbing two homeless men earlier this year, was arrested on June 26. The accused, Manusi Mothupi, made several appearances in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court since his arrest, News24 previously reported.

It is alleged he used a butcher's knife to stab the homeless man in the stomach, hand and left knee. The second attempted murder charge relates to an attack on another man on March 3, also in Magnolia Park. Mothupi allegedly stabbed him in his left arm and chest, according to the charge sheet. Mothupi's bail application was denied in November and he will remain behind bars until his next appearance on January 23, 2020, when the disclosure of the docket will be made and a trial date will be set. The police and National Prosecuting Authority said Mothupi was not connected to the murders of the five homeless men.
