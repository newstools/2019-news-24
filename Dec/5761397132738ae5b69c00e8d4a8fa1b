The opposition in the West African state of Guinea vowed on Monday to boycott legislative elections set for February and prevent them from taking place, in a dispute focussed on the country's electoral roll. "We have decided we cannot take part," opposition chief Cellou Dalein Diallo said after meeting with the heads of around 20 opposition groups. "It's not just a question of boycotting the elections and standing by with our arms folded. We will prevent these elections from taking place," he said.
