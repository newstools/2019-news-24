The family of former gang boss Rashied Staggie was still trying to come to terms with his death, said his brother Solomon Staggie. The former Hard Livings gang leader was killed in a hail of bullets on Friday morning. "At the moment there are a lot of family members coming to the family home. They are in great bereavement, they are in sorrow," Staggie told the media as family and friends slowly arrived at the family home. Despite media headlines, he said the death of any person impacts on the family. "[I]f you read the media, they will say 'there's another gangster', but it's somebody's brother, it's somebody's husband, somebody's family," said Staggie.
