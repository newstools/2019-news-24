About R120 million will be invested in revamping the look of District Six once talks about the project have been finalised. This is according to Cape Town mayor, Dan Plato, who said he is not happy that the area has not been redeveloped 25 years into democracy. He says since the forced removals in District Six where 2 000 houses were demolished and residents moved to outlying areas, not much has been done to restore it. “It is unreal, it is inhumane that we cannot get District Six right. I want to pick that up.” He says he is currently discussing the revamping with national government and other officials to come up with a plan. Plato says Thoko Didiza, the minister of agriculture, land reform and rural development, has bought into the idea and the budget will be finalised this month to allow the work to commence early next year. He says the work will begin with the underground infrastructure in early 2020 and old buildings will be revamped. There are 900 affordable houses to be built. “Firstly, we need to get the underground infrastructure in place because you cannot build the top structure if the underground is not done. “The face of District Six will change. That is so important to me,” Plato says. Plato says he will be working with the ward councillors to drive the project.
