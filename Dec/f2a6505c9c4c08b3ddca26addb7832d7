Seven suspects are still at large following a house robbery in Northcliff, Johannesburg, earlier this month. CCTV footage of the incident was widely shared on social media and it shows a white Renault Sandero parked in front of the home. A man gets out of the car and proceeds to pry open the gate with a crowbar. Four men then jump out of the car and make their way onto the property. 'No one was home' "I was really happy that no one was home. The speed at which those guys came onto the property, there was no way that one could have stopped them," Donald Liphoko told News24. Liphoko lives on the property with his wife and sons. "Because they were a large group, they were able to go into every single room." Liphoko said the men stole TVs, laptops, monitors, a phone, Bluetooth speakers and an iPad. "Unfortunately, my wife's jewellery is in a display case. So, they opened that thing and helped themselves to her jewellery." "A lot of the pieces are sentimental and are hard to replace." The assailants also stole her shoes. Gone in 10 minutes They were able to steal the desired goods, pack them into the getaway car and drive off - all in under 10 minutes. Liphoko and his family had contacted the police after being notified of the break-in. "The cops were here pretty quickly. We wrote a statement and opened a case the same day. And we were allocated a detective," he said. A forensic team was also sent to the home to take fingerprints. "But we were unlucky because the guys were wearing gloves." A case of home invasion and house robbery was opened, and the police are still investigating. "Obviously, I am not happy that I was robbed, but I am kind of grateful that there was no loss of life," Liphoko said.
