According to the Hawks, the councillor, Roseline Vitbooi offered to assist the Magopeni family, who had three of their members die after being trapped inside a burning shack on July 3, 2017 in East London.

"The municipality approved the application on the July 13, 2017 and paid the amount into the affected family's bank account." "It is further alleged that the councillor then ordered the family to hand over half of the money to her, an instruction they complied with."
