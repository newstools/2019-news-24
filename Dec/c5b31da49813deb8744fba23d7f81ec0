About 600 bidders and onlookers stood ten-deep inside Bosasa's Imbizo Hall on Wednesday morning, braving wet and cold conditionsÂ to grab a piece of the Bosasa pie. The first day of a three-day auction got under way with intense bidding for nearly 140 cars, trucks and bakkies that belonged to the corruption-accused company in Krugersdorp. Two cars that belonged to late Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson were the talk of the day - his most recent one, a blue BMW X5, was sold for R590 000, while his previous car, a Porsche Cayenne Turbo S, went under the hammer for R500 000. On the final episode of season 1 of The Story, we wrap up the year by speaking to News24 investigative reporter Kyle Cowan about Bosasa, the auction and the controversy surrounding the embattled business.
