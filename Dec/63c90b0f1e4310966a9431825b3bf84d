Washington
â€“ The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday said it had agreed to a
$368.4m credit facility for strife-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, to enable
its authorities "to meet their urgent balance of payment needs". "The economic environment
remains challenging and vulnerable to shocks," the IMF said in a
statement. "Real GDP growth is
projected to decelerate to 4.5% in 2019 from 5.8% in 2018... International
reserves have fallen to critically low levels." President Felix Tshisekedi, who
took office in January this year, has vowed to enact sweeping reform and root
out corruption in the poor but mineral-rich central African country. DRC was ranked 161 out of 180 on
the Transparency International corruption perceptions index released in January
2019. The IMF said the new government
was committed to addressing "issues related to poor governance, a
difficult business environment, and pervasive poverty".
