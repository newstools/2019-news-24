Paris
â€“ French President Emmanuel Macron will travel to Niger to pay homage to 71
soldiers massacred in a jihadist attack earlier this month, the president's
office announced on Tuesday. Macron will join a ceremony over
the weekend in the capital Niamey to pay his respects to the soldiers killed at
the Inates military camp in the Sahel country's western Tillaberi region on
December 10, the Elysee Palace said. Macron will also meet with his
Nigerien counterpart, Mahamadou Issoufou, in Niamey, it added in a statement. The two are to discuss plans for
a summit in the southern French town of Pau on January 13, bringing together
Issoufou and the presidents of Burkina Faso, Mali, Chad and Mauritania. The five Sahel leaders met in
Niamey on Sunday to prepare for the summit, which was initially set for
December 16, but was postponed because of the Inates attack. France has a 4 500-strong
anti-jihadist force, dubbed Barkhane, supporting the five countries fighting a
seven-year-old jihadist revolt. Thousands of civilians have been
killed, and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes. Issoufou announced late on Tuesday
that a square in Niamey would be named after the commander of the Inates camp,
Lieutenant Colonel Hassane Anoutab, who was killed along with his subordinates
in the December 10 massacre. Macron will visit nearby Ivory
Coast on Friday and Saturday before heading to Niger, the Elysee statement
said.
