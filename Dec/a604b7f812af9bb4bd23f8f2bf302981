Four-year-old American
twin sisters managed to escape a car crash that left their father dead, to go
look for help. Rosaline and
Aurora Crider were able to unbuckle themselves from their car seats, crawl out
of a broken window and climb up a steep and muddy embankment to get help, Buzzfeed
News reports. Standing on the
side of a two-lane roadway, the little girls got the attention of a woman
driving by. “They kept saying, ‘My daddy, my daddy,’” she told
local authorities. The woman, who didn’t want her name released by the
police, looked for the vehicle the girls may have been in. Not seeing one, she called 911. After police
arrived, the girls were taken to a local hospital with minor injuries, PEOPLE
reports. "This is
miraculous," Washington State Patrol trooper Heather Axtman said, calling
the girls' actions "brave and heroic".  Authorities are still investigating what caused the
crash and it’s unclear why the twins’ dad, Corey Simmons, veered to the right
of the road, New York Times
reports. Corey, who wasn’t wearing his seat belt, is believed
to have died instantly. Esther Crider,
the girls' mother, told local media that on the day of the crash Corey had
helped her parents install an oven. He then picked
up the twins from day-care, stopped at a convenience store for snacks, and
headed home. "Corey
drove up and down that road every day for about five years," she said. "I don't
know what happened." Esther said the
two girls are still coming to grips with losing their dad. Sources: Buzzfeed
