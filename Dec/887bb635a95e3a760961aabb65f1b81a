In an effort to educate children about the danger of fires and how to prevent it, the City of Cape Town’s fire and rescue services hosted a fire awareness campaign at Lunar Crescent Park in Khwezi Park on Friday 6 December. The event was organised by Khwezi Western Cape on Wellness (WoW) after two recent fires in the area. WoW is a healthy life style initiative initiated by the provincial department of Health to promote wellness. WoW champion Unathi Yanta said the programme promotes safety in communities. “Now that schools are closed and it’s festive season people are having fun and    braaing until midnight which is dangerous. And the children are the ones who are in danger,” she said. Yanta said they felt the programme was needed to empower children. She encouraged parents to keep items, such as match sticks out of reach of children. Firefighter Tumekile Nazo said they teach children how to escape in an event of fire. “When the house or shack is burning we advise them to kneel down and crawl instead of standing. And if someone is burnt, they must first pour cold water on the wound and wait for few minutes before they treat it and then call an ambulance,” said Nazo. He also urged parents to pack away items like paraffin and match sticks. “Parents need to show children all the exits so they can escape when there is a fire,” he concluded.
