Two luxury cars that belonged to late Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson went under the hammer at an auction at the African Global Operations campus in Krugersdorp on Wednesday. The first to go was Watson's blue BMW X5 which was sold to the highest bidder for R590 000.Â A Porsche Cayenne Turbo S was the second to go for R500 000. The new owner of the Porsche said it did not matter who the car belonged to, but rather that he got a good deal. "I love them, I think it's the best SUV on the road. I'm happy with it, he [Watson] looked after his cars," said Graham McCarthy. The first day of a three-day auction got underway with intense bidding for nearly 140 cars, trucks and bakkies that belonged to the corruption accused company. The buyers will have to pay a 10% commission, 15% value added tax and a R2 500 documentation fee, bringing the price of the BMW to R740 000, and Porsche to R627 500 - but both the purchases are subject to consent - which means the individuals who used the cars, which are both company vehicles, have first option to buy them and only if they decline, will the bidders be able to take delivery The auction is set to resume on Thursday and Friday. On Thursday, three large properties including Bosasa's head office park, a 26ha property on which the Lindela Repatriation Centre stands - as well as a massive property around the corner from the head office on which sits a copper smelting plant and several buildings.
