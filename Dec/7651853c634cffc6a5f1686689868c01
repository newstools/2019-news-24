Julius Malema says he is not a dictator, just a hard worker. He spoke to journalists at his first media briefing on Sunday after being reelected president of the EFF. The party's top six officials were all elected unopposed late on Saturday night. "I pay attention to the smallest detail. I know everything that is happening in this conference," Malema said. "I work hard. I come from nothing. I didn't dictate to anybody to be where I am here. I don’t care who thinks what about me. Nothing. Because I know everything else I have, I've worked for it and I've earned it," he said. Some 3 000 of the party’s delegates flocked to Nasrec where the EFF has been hosting its second national elective conference, which is currently in its third and penultimate day.
