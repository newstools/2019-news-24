The EFF has spent well over R32m on its second elective conference, the national people's assembly (NPA), giving its delegates VIP treatment, treasurer general Leigh-Ann Mathys told journalists on Friday. Mathys said statutory bodies from legislature and National Assembly contributed to the expense. "We have now increased our seats in Parliament. We have pretty much doubled in Parliament and also at all our legislatures. Our income from the IEC (Electoral Commission of SA), from Parliament and from the provincial legislatures has pretty much doubled since June 2014," she said. She added that the R32m was spent on transporting delegates and obtaining space at the Nasrec expo centre. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.
