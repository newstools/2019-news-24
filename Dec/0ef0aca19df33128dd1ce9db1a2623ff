Register for Sexual Offenders. Speaking to DRUM KZN police spokesperson Colonel
Thembeka Mbele said the accused sexually violated six young girls between the
ages of six to 13 in 2017 in Sawoti. His method was to lure his victims to his
home, rape and then threaten to kill them if they told anyone about the
incident. Mbele further explained how the accused would at times offer the
victims a R2 bribe for their silence. “His secret was revealed by one victim
during an argument with another victim. An older relative who was with them
overheard the argument and questioned them. They informed her that the suspect
had raped them.” The matter was reported to Sawoti police
and the docket was transferred to the Port Shepstone Family Violence, Child
Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. Four other
victims came forward and the accused was arrested and charged. He made several
court appearances until he was convicted and sentenced” said Mbele. Speaking in light of the sentencing KZN
Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula said such a sentence
was fit for someone who misuses the trust children have for adults. “The pleasure we experience when the law
takes its course is indescribable. We welcome the sentence handed down to the
accused who abused the trust of children for his own vile reasons. It is sad
when the people trusted the most by our children turn out to be monsters. This
sentence is especially welcomed as we observe 16 Days of Activism” Jula said.
