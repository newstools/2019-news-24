A
rescue team on a mission to recover a trapped mineworker in a gold mine near
Orkney, North West, will resume their search on Sunday morning after an
overnight ground fall forced it to withdraw. Village Main Reef (VMR)
spokesperson James Duncan said he was aware of reports that the worker had been
found dead, but would not confirm this until the body had been recovered. "We expect that to be during
the course of this morning," he told News24. The bodies of three of the four
mineworkers who were trapped were recovered by rescue workers on Saturday
evening at the Tau Lekoa mine. Five workers had been trapped by
a rockfall following seismic activity in the mine on Friday afternoon. One
worker who was rescued soon afterwards remains in a serious but stable
condition in hospital. A team of more than 100 people – volunteers
from the company's own workforce, as well as specially trained rescue teams
from Mines Rescue Services – have been involved in the rescue, some 1 350m
below the surface, dealing with difficult conditions because of the volume of
fallen rocks and the threat of further rockfalls. The National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM) has called for "drastic action" to improve the safety standards
and procedures at mines. Duncan previously told News24
they would not respond to any allegations about safety until the Mine Health
and Safety Inspectorate investigated the circumstances.
