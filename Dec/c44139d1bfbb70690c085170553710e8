Cars worth no more than R700 000, a R5 000 per month cellphone allowance, flying economy and no security upgrades to private residences: these are some of the "sacrifices" ministers, premiers and MECs will be making, according to the new ministerial handbook. And the changes will be made considering the "stagnant economy", Public Service and Administration Minister Senzo Mchunu said on Monday, as he presented the ministerial handbook to members of the media. A ministerial handbook has been a long time coming. Work started on it when the late Collins Chabane was still minister of public service and administration. The previous handbook was published in 2007. After a draft handbook was presented to the Cabinet in June this year, President Cyril Ramaphosa reportedly demanded further cuts. "In line with the need to be circumspect on the fiscal constraints we find ourselves in and to ensure fiscal prudence, the Cabinet referred the guide for members of the executive back to a committee of ministers comprising the ministers of finance, public works and infrastructure as well as the public service and administration to revisit certain aspects in the guide for members of the executive [the guide] to curb costs, while not compromising government operations," read Mchunu's statement. The changes to the handbook include the following: Mchunu said it was envisaged similar changes would take place to cut these costs in the public service and public sector in general, including mayors, executive committees, directors-general and state-owned entities. Public Service and Administration director-general Richard Levin said the department was working with Treasury to determine what savings these measures would amount to.
