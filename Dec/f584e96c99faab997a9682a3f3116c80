belief that initiates should not get water. So, before and after the ceremony
they don't get water. This leads to mental
confusion, an electrolyte imbalance and renal failure,"
Mabuyane said. Mkhize also
recommended initiations should be restricted to winter as "no deaths are recorded in the winter months". As a
result, the government has pledged to donate water to initiation schools in the
province and investigate the safety of these schools.
