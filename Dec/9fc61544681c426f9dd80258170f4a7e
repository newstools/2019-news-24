WATCH | Child ripped from woman's arms by police as refugees removed from UNHCR offices A child was ripped away from the arms of a defenceless woman as police forcibly removed hundreds of refugees from outside the offices of the UN High Commission for Refugees in Cape Town's CBD on Wednesday. The men are expected to appear in court soon. A spokesperson for the group, Papy Sukami, said the dispute related to allegations that one of the prominent leaders of the group raised money for his personal interests. 'We need help' Refugees felt the man had alienated the group from agencies which might help broker a resolution. Sukami said pangas were taken into the church on Sunday and parts of the church were damaged. He said that after the removal of the person, it was hoped that lines of communication with NGOs and government agencies would be reopened again. "We need the Red Cross, the Gift of the Givers to help," he said, adding that they also needed medical care for children and food. About 600 people, including more than 100 children, have been living in the church on Greenmarket Square since October 30, after they were forcibly removed from a sit-in protest at the nearby Waldorf Arcade. They had hoped to be relocated to a country other than their countries of origin, saying they were at risk in South Africa.
