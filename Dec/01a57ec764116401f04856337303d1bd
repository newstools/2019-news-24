The lights we love may be driving insects to the brink of
extinction. The so-called “insect apocalypse” is being urged on by light
pollution. An analysis published in the journal Biological Conservation, says the pollution
may result in 40% of all insects being extinct within decades. Researchers say that artificial light at night could affect
insects in different ways, according to Nature World News. The pollution of light affects insects in many ways
including their movements, finding mates to reproduce with, development,
finding food and being eaten, according to The Guardian. Insects like mayflies are a key area of worry as they only
live for one day and could be knocked out in 24 hours if they follow artificial
light away from natural breeding areas. In some species like firefly beetles, the light pollution hinders
the creatures from finding a mate. A decline in insect numbers may impact global ecosystems in
a catastrophic way as they are crucial to plant pollination and breaking down
waste. Brett Seymore, author of the research, says there are a
number of different fixes that could easily reduce impacts, including light
timers, covers to lessen light pollution and bulbs that don’t mimic daylight,
