"We will not rest until we find those responsible for the killing of our young colleague. I have directed that all critical resources are mobilised to identify those responsible and bring them to book as soon as possible," he said. Naidoo urged the public to come forward with information related to the murder or contact the SAPS Crime Stop number 086 00 10111. "We also want to encourage people with a smart phone to download the MySAPSApp which will allow users to provide tip-offs and/or have access to nearest police stations, to the SAPS social media platforms. Callers may remain anonymous and all information will be treated with strictest confidence," he said. Police Minister Bheki Cele will on Tuesday pay his last respects to late Warrant Officer Theena Pillay. Pillay was gunned down outside his house on Sunday as he was leaving for work. He managed to return fire, killing the gunman instantly. Pillay, however, succumbed to his injuries. According to Lieutenant General Christine Mgwenya, 29 police officers were killed in the line of duty during the 2017/2018 financial year. However, that number is lower than the 56 killed while off duty over the same period.
