This young woman died after slipping in the shower and
breaking her neck. Irena Milosevic was taking a shower at her parent’s home in
Serbia when the tragic incident occurred. The 30-year-old was at home with her mom and dad, Vesela
and Nebosja, and her grandmother when she went into the bathroom to take a
shower, according to local media. Her parents started worrying after she’d been in the
bathroom for an hour. They began knocking on the door but there was no reply. When her parents finally managed to open the door they
reportedly found Irena dead in the bathroom. Investigations by local police revealed that she’d slipped
because of a large amount of steam and slippery tiles in the bathroom. She reportedly broke her neck from the impact of the fall
and was found lying on the bathroom floor. Her parents called emergency services, but paramedics could
only confirm their daughter’s death. Irena was buried in the local cemetery with the whole
village reportedly attending the funeral.  “She was positive and always ready to help,” one of her
friends told local media. “We joked with her that it was time for her to get married
as her brother got married last year. It hurts our souls that such a beautiful
and kind girl was so tragically killed.” Source:
