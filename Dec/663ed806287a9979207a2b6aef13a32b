The United States said on Wednesday it would name an ambassador to Sudan for the first time in 23 years, during a visit to Washington by the country's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. The two nations will proceed with an exchange of ambassadors, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced. "This decision is a meaningful step forward in strengthening the US-Sudan bilateral relationship, particularly as the civilian-led transitional government works to implement ... vast reforms," Pompeo said in a statement. Hamdok met with one of Pompeo's top deputies, David Hale.
