A video circulating on social media shows a woman allegedly being manhandled by a number of Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) officers at a petrol station in Lyttleton, Pretoria, late on Tuesday night. According to civil society activist Yusuf Abramjee, the womanÂ was alone and didn't want to pull over in the dark fearing fake cops. She drove to a nearby petrol station where the officers proceeded to manhandle her. In the video, the woman exits her white VW Polo at around 23:25 as the metro officers approach her vehicle. She is then pulled toward a TMPD kombi by three male and one female officers. The seemingly distressed woman resists and appears to be calling for help.
