THANK you for the article on road rage (The Witness, November 28) which was quite enlightening. I would like to make two comments. Taxi drivers are a primary cause of other motorists getting road rage. They stop in unauthorised places, cut in unexpectedly and use emergency lanes with no respect for other road users. I had to laugh when I read that bad drivers should be reported to the traffic authori-    ties! Many years ago, the Mpimpa hotline was established but that has faded away and traffic officers are now rarely seen on the roads. The proliferation of heavy vehicles on Fields Hill during the hours when they are supposed to be banned is ample proof that the officers in khaki are not doing their    job. TONY BALL Pinetown
