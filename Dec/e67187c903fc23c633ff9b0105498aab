"We want everyone celebrating in Gauteng, whether outdoors or in the comfort of their homes, to have a good time," Mawela said. "Every resident's safety and security is our top priority.

Meanwhile, in KwaZulu-Natal, the Department of Health urged New Year's Eve revellers to exercise caution. In a statement, head of department Dr Sandile Tshabalala said "alcohol consumption is usually a major contributor to otherwise avoidable calamities, such as motor vehicle crashes or interpersonal conflicts, which may result in serious injury, loss of a limb or death." "We're, therefore, saying that everybody needs to be careful around this time. Drinking and driving is a problem. In ushering [in] the new year, we urge people to take care of themselves. Avoid alcohol or don't overconsume it," Tshabalala said. In Cape Town, mayoral committee member for community services and health, Zahid Badroodien called on beach goers to exercise caution on New Year's Day. "Historically, Boxing Day and New Year's Day are the two biggest beach days in Cape Town," Badroodien said in a statement. "This year, mother nature stole the show on Boxing Day, so we expect many people to make up for the lost opportunity on New Year's Day â€“ in spite of the windy conditions forecast." Badroodien appealed to beach goers to only swim in designated areas, look out for rip currents, to not drink and swim and to supervise children at all times.
