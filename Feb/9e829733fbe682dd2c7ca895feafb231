The committee, which was established on December 6, is intended to introduce legislation that will amend Section 25 of the Constitution to allow expropriation without compensation. "The resolution of the land question forms part of the founding principles of the African National Congress," ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said when he announced Didiza's election. "In essence, it is the ultimate expression of transformation and restitution. With this in mind, we wish the committee well as they embark on this historic process," he added. READ: Committee adopts report recommending expropriation without compensationIn November, the Joint Constitutional Review Committee (CRC) adopted a resolution that Section 25 of the Constitution be amended to allow expropriation without compensation. Following a lengthy process of public consultation and deliberation, the EFF's Floyd Shivambu sponsored the motion recommending that the Constitution be amended, mirroring the recommendation the ANC previously proposed to the CRC.  Included in the recommendations was the setting up of an ad-hoc committee to draft the wording of the amendment. Many opposition parties, including the DA and Cope, believe the Constitution already makes provision for land reform.  #Mthembu We are fast tracking land reform by implementing our resolution on the expropriation of land without compensation.
