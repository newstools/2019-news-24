"A passenger was identified, and she and her luggage were searched. "A body search by members of Customs and Excise initially revealed she had concealed drugs in a body wrap around her waist," Colonel Katlego Mogale said in a statement on Friday. The suspect was arrested and sent for X-rays. "The X-rays further revealed that she had swallowed foreign objects. "Those objects comprised of multiple 'bullets' containing drugs with an estimated street value of ±R181 000," he added. This came after an intelligence driven operation by the multi-disciplinary narcotics team at the airport. "People constantly attempt to smuggle drugs through this airport, despite continuous arrests and successful prosecution of such perpetrators. Smugglers are warned that, with the capacity and capabilities at this port of entry, they will definitely be detected," Mogale warned. The suspect, who is facing charges of dealing in drugs, will appear in the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court on Monday.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
