According to auctioneer Andrew Miller, breeders from around the country bring their best rams to buy and sell to each other. The rams belonging to Wynand du Toit and Boeta Wessels each were brought at the highest price because of their exceptional genetics. "Body weight and the length of the wool are important but it is more the genetics and breeding ability that command higher prices," Miller told News24. "Last year a ram sold for R325 000, a world record, but that was an exceptional case." "R180 000 for a ram is still exceptional, especially when considering that there were two," he said. A total of 52 rams were sold at the auction; the average sale was around R40 000. Six rams were unsold.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
