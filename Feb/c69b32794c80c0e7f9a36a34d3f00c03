Jenni Evans Two people were arrested after bushels of dagga and a bag of magic mushrooms were found in a house in Kraaifontein early on Friday, Western Cape police said. Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut said Crime Intelligence and Flying Squad officers raided the house. They allegedly found a large quantity of dagga bushes, plants in a makeshift hydroponic laboratory, dried dagga and the bag of Psilocybin mushrooms, which is considered to be a psychedelic drug. Asked why they were arrested given a recent Constitutional Court ruling allowing personal use, Traut said the exact quantity seized had not yet been established, but it fell into the category of "a sizeable amount". The men are expected to be charged with dealing in drugs when they appear in the Kuilsriver Magistrate's Court on Monday. A legal challenge is currently being prepared to decriminalise magic mushrooms.
