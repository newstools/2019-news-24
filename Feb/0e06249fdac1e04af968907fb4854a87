after he and some classmates were allegedly ordered to lower their pants and
stand with their backs to him after a pupil's money disappeared. The
woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of her child, said her son
told her the male staff member called in each boy one at a time at the primary
school in Cape Town. He claimed they were told to drop
their pants and stand in their underwear with their backs to him. The
child refused, but was allegedly told that every boy had to do it. Western Cape police confirmed a
case of crimen injuria (impairing the dignity and/or privacy of another) had
been reported and was under investigation. Jessica Shelver, spokesperson for
Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schäfer, said a meeting was held with parents
on Monday evening. "The meeting with Grade 6
parents on Monday evening was to address the fact that the sports coach's
actions were not acceptable and not in line with procedure," she said. "The principal has reported
that the parents who were present at the meeting accepted the fact that the
intention was not to cause embarrassment or humiliation, but rather to try and
resolve the theft issue." The
sports coach, who is employed by the school governing body, will however face a
disciplinary hearing. Shelver said counselling and
support would be provided to pupils as required.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
