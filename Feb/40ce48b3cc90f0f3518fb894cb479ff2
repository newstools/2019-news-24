The first occurred on the M1 highway northbound, before the Xavier off-ramp in Robertsham, south of Johannesburg's CBD. The taxi reportedly crashed into the Armco barriers on the road. When paramedics arrived, passengers were already out of the taxi and were found seated on the barrier. "Paramedics assessed the patients and found that 11 people had sustained minor to moderate injuries," said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring. Meiring added that the driver was the most severely injured as he was found trapped in the vehicle in "a serious condition". According to Meiring, "paramedics utilised various rescue tools to free the trapped driver from the vehicle. Once freed, paramedics provided the driver with pain relief medication". In a separate accident, at the N12 and R28 intersection in Westonaria, a collision between a taxi and two light motor vehicles left 11 people injured. Meiring said towing services personnel had already moved the vehicle by the time paramedics arrived. "One light motor vehicle was found on its roof while the other was a short distance away," said Meiring. No fatalities were reported in both accidents. Passengers in both accidents were transported to local hospitals for further treatment. Local authorities were on the scene.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
