A search team made up of police and members of the public was immediately activated as soon as police were alerted, SAPS spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said in a statement. According to police information, Othandwayo Zenzile, 4, Linandle Zenzile and Nande Nombewu, both 3, were playing in an open field at about 12:15 on Tuesday. "At about 15:00, the parents realised they were missing and went to look for them on their own. After their own search proved futile, they contacted the police at 22:00. "A team of police officers (Motherwell detectives, Vispol, FCS, K9 Search and Rescue and Airwing) and the community started searching for the children in nearby bushes," Naidu said.
