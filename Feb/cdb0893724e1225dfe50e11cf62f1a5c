Police officials in the Eastern
Cape are keeping their streets clean of criminals and illicit criminal dealings
especially after repossessing 35 bags of dagga worth R1.5M in street value. The Constitutional Court might’ve
decriminalized the private
use of marijuana in 2018, however it is considered as illegal to
deal or sell it outside of one’s home or even be found in possession of it
outside of a private dwelling. In a media statement released by
the Eastern Cape SAPS media center, two suspects aged 31 and 27 were arrested
by Indwe SAPS in King Williams Town after they were found in possession of 19
bags of dagga in the trailer of the Toyata Quantum they were driving. READ MORE: 3

40-year-old suspects were nabbed by East London K9 officials, after they were
stopped for making an illegal U-turn which led to the discovery of 16 bags of
dagga in black bags in their vehicle. The recovered dagga which is
estimated to be at the value of R500 000, has since been repossessed by SAPS
along with the vehicle it was discovered in. Although the quantity of
marijuana consumption is yet to be declared by the government, possession of
155 grams constitutes as dealing according to the Constitution under the Drugs and Drugs Trafficking
Act. Eastern Cape Provincial
Commissioner Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga, has commended officials on their
outstanding work, “Well done to the ground forces
who leave no space for criminals. Your vigilance and dedication in pursuing the
vision of the SAPS is commendable.” All four suspects face charges of
possession as well as dealing with dagga, and will appear in their local
magistrate’s courts during the week.
