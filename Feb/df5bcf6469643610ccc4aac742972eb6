FARMERS and residents around Umvoti are urged to report all cases of stock theft to the police. The call was made after police received a tip-off about a truck en route to Matimaloto transporting cattle and acted on it. Colonel Phendulani Shezi of Greytown SAPS said policemen stopped the driver of the truck in the Ahrends area. Upon further investigation it emerged that the man was transporting the cattle to Mbulwana. Shezi said: “The driver told the police that the owner of the cattle asked him to deliver the cattle to Mbulwana. When we phoned the owner, he informed the police that he feared that his cattle will die of hunger as Weenen is hit by severe drought. Police opened an inquiry. The driver was not arrested, however, the police are investigating the matter.” According to police, stock theft is rife in Greytown and surrounding areas. “Between December 2018 and January there has been an increase in stock theft. We made arrests and recoveries. We have noted an increase of stock theft in Muden and Greytown. According to our records, stock theft has decreased in Msinga as compared to the previous months.” Shezi urged farmers and residents to work with the police in the fight against stock theft. He explained: “It is important to report when your cow is missing. Over and above that, people fail to look after their cattle. Another thing that we have discovered was that residents are not active in reporting cases in time.” Shezi urged all owners of livestock to brand their animals to avoid stock theft. He added: “Stock branding is important as it helps the police to check for the rightful owners. We appeal to all farmers to brand their animals.”
