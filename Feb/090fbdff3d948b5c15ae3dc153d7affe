The driver (36) was shot in the head and died at the scene. It is believed the shooting occured around 06:48. Western Cape police spokesperson Captain Frederick van Wyk told News24 that the circumstances surrounding the shooting incident are under investigation. “A murder case was registered for investigation,” Van Wyk said. “Our crime scene experts [were] on the scene combing the area for clues. “Anyone with any information about this fatal shooting incident is kindly requested to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or Lentegeur Police Station directly.” A resident at the scene told People’s Post that the driver was well known in the area. “I was getting my grandchildren ready for school when we heard several gunshots,” she says. “There have been lots of gunshots fired recently in the area so we thought it was random shots. Then I heard someone was shot and I went to see what happened. I often take the taxi from the garage and never saw that a driver was shot here before.” The garage also serves as a halfway point and semi taxi rank for the residents of Woodlands and Lentegeur.
