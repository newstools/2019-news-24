She was the sister of former Springbok and Sharks player Ruan Pienaar. O'Ehley’s husband Edmund told Netwerk24 that he and his son, and his daughter, Kayla, 10, were travelling to De Doorns on Saturday so that Edmund jnr could play cricket. "I think it helps a bit to take away the heartache and to keep the thoughts away. "We are all very heart sore. The children are very small. I don't think they understand completely," he said. Messages of condolences were posted on both Gysie and Edmund’s Facebook profiles on Saturday.
