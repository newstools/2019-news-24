According to Netcare911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst, approximately 50 people sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate. "All the patients were transported by various ambulance services to hospitals," Herbs said. He added that the road has been closed off while police concluded investigations. Tshwane emergency spokesperson Johan Pieterse said SAPS and SBV officials were on scene conducting investigations. "I know everybody is asking whether this was an attempted robbery, but it did not look like that because everything was still intact. I think it was purely driver mistake," Pieterse said.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
