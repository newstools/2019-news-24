EPWORTH celebrated a number of successes when the 2019 Dusi Canoe Marathon came to an end at Blue Lagoon on Saturday. Current and past pupils, as well as staff members, featured prominently among the top paddlers. In the U18 girls’ competition, Epworth swept the podium with Amy Peckett, Cara Waud and Shannon-Ann Parker-Dennison coming first, second and third respectively. Amy showed her pedigree in the ladies race by placing third with fellow teammates Cara and Shannon coming seventh and eighth respectively. Epworth is also proud of past pupils Tamika Haw (class of 2009) and Tracey Oellermann­ (class of 2018) who came second and sixth respectively, and of staff members Kim Peek and Melissa van Rooyen for ending in ninth and tenth positions respectively. A total of nine Epworth pupils participated in this year’s Dusi. — Supplied.
