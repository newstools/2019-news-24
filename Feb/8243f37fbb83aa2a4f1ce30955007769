MEC Panyaza Lesufi and the school are continuing visiting learners who are in hospitals," he said. The school remain closed on Saturday and has been taken over by the Department of Labour and police as they conduct separate investigations into what caused the structure to collapse. Structural engineers who have been on the ground since Friday have erected scaffolding below the triple story blocks of the school. Plastered cracks below the first floor were visibly clear which could have forced engineers to balance the buildings from collapsing further. "The school remains cordoned off by police as they are investigating what caused the tragedy. The school has been declared an emergency area. Structural engineers are on the scene. As the department, we want to know what caused the accident," Mosuwe said. The head of department thanked all who played a role in assisting with the removal of pupils trapped under the rubble.
