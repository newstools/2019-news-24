saved her life more than a decade ago was her current boyfriend. Lin Xiaofen, from Taiwan,
needed emergency treatment after being involved in a serious car accident in 2008, Mirror
reports. To stabilise her condition, she was given nearly five litres of donor blood as well as a litre of isolated platelets. Lin eventually recovered but was left with a disorder,
which meant she needed further donations of blood, Metro
reports. Two years ago she told her boyfriend, Lian Zhiceng, about her horrific accident. The
couple have been together now for four years. “Could it be my blood you used?” Lian jokingly asked Lin. Lin then approached medical authorities to ask for
information about her blood donor, Bored
Panda reports. The couple was shocked when told the donor was “Mr Lian Zhiceng”. “When they told me it was a Mr
Lian from Hsinchu, I was surprised," Lin said in a clip shared by Pear
Video. Meanwhile, Lian says he felt an instant connection with Lin
when they first met. He’s now encouraging people to donate blood. “You might
have a chance to meet your future wife,” he quipped. Sources: Metro,
