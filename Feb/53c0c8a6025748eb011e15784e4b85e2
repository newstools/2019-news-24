THE Sathya Sai International Organisation Midlands Region will , on behalf of the SANBS Blood Donor Clinic, host the second blood clinic of the year, having already begun proceedings in January. Going on for almost 20 years, the Sai organisation was able to collect blood from 66 donors in January and hopes to collect more this time around. “South Africa is the second-highest collector of blood after India who are first. “This year we have volunteered to do six clinics throughout the year,” said co-ordinator for the blood donor clinics on behalf of the Sai organisation, Nithya Naidoo. The blood donor clinic will be held at the TPA Primary School on the corner of Mysore and Aintree Road on March 10 from 10 am to 4 pm. “We will also be running awareness drives for the blood drive this Saturday, March 2, at Debi Place, Truro Hall, Chota Motala Road and Northway Mall. “It is essential for people to understand that giving blood is to give life and therefore we encourage everyone to participate,” said Naidoo.
