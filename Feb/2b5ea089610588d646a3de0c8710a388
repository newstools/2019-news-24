The child and three friends were all caught in the river's currents but the others were found, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said. News24 reported on Saturday that police and rescue officials were deployed from the Dusi Canoe Marathon event to the area where the children were located. They were reportedly playing in the river when they were swept away. Zwane said on Sunday that the child had not been found but that the search was still on. TimesLive reported that divers, the K9 dog unit from SAPS and Durban Fire and Rescue were all roped in during Friday's search. It was also reported that, according to the child's grandmother, she and her friends were playing in the river because they had skipped "civvies" day at school, because they did not have decent clothes to wear.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
