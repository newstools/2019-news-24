The committee held a meeting about the police's current anti-gang strategy after committee chairperson Francois Beukman expressed concern about reports that more than 185 people were killed in gang-related violence on the Cape Flats in the Western Cape since March 2018. Cele said there were "hard-core criminals out there". He said he spent most of his time and resources in the Western Cape because of the high prevalence of deaths in the province. He likened the anti-gang unit to a fire station that is in the process of being equipped but whose firefighters must still go out to fight fires. He said he visited affected communities and that the anti-gang unit had brought some "relaxation" there. "I know the Western Cape now," he said. He said residents of Uitzicht had told him that they could now send their children to the shops once again because the streets were safer. Shebeens were also a major problem because crime and "general nonsense" happen in their vicinity, Cele said. Regulating liquor licences is a provincial matter, but he wants overarching legislation to deal with it. National police commissioner Khehla Sitole said 150 police officers from outside the Western Cape had been deployed in the province to help the anti-gang unit. Policing in the Western Cape is an election issue in the province and the DA says it wants a provincial police force.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
