Celebrations to mark the 107th birthday of Rebecca Kotane were held at her home in Diepkloof, Soweto, on Tuesday. Kotane is the wife of the late SACP secretary general Moses Kotane. Both the SACP and ANC were present at the celebration. Roads were closed for the festivity. ANC Gauteng chairperson David Makhura highlighted the role women played in the fight against apartheid. "On a day like this we must acknowledge the role of women. Women were there in the front lines of the struggle for freedom in our country," he said. "Mama Kotane was on the streets mobilising for the Freedom Charter," he added. ANC secretary general Ace Magashule, who delivered the keynote speech, said Kotane was an example of the selfless leaders the party had in the past.
