A look at one of US President Donald Trump's statements from his State of the Union address on Tuesday night and how it compares with the facts: WOMEN IN WORKFORCE TRUMP: "All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before." THE FACTS: Of course, there are more women working than ever before. But that's due to population growth â€” and not something that Trump can credit to any his policies. Highlights from Trump's State of the Union address Face to face with emboldened Democrats in a State of the Union address, President Donald Trump on Tuesday called on Washington to end "ridiculous partisan investigations" and cast aside "revenge, resistance and retribution." The big question is whether a greater percentage of women is working or searching for a job than at any point in history. And on this count, women have enjoyed better times. Women's labour force participation rate right now is 57.5%, according to the Labour Department. The rate has ticked up recently, but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60%. ENERGY TRUMP, in prepared excerpts: "We have unleashed a revolution in American energy - the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world." THE FACTS: True, if "we" means Trump and his recent predecessors. It's not all to Trump's credit. The government says the US became the world's top natural gas producer in 2013, under Barack Obama's administration. The US now leads the world in oil production, too, under Trump. That's largely because of a boom in production from shale oil, which also began under Obama.  KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
