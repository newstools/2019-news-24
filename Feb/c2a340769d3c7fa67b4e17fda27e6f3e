Lifman told News24 that he was at a golf championships tournament when a silver Corsa pulled up and a shot was fired. "It (the bullet) hit the ground near my feet somewhere and nothing hit me, so I wasn't injured," said Lifman. "I retreated... and pulled my firearm and they sped off." The police told Netwerk24 that they were informed of the incident but that a charge had not been laid. In January last year, the Cape Town Magistrate's Court heard that another controversial businessman, Nafiz Modack, allegedly planned to have Lifman murdered.

The Cape Town Magistrate's Court also heard last year how Lifman allegedly had confidential police information while in the dock for an extortion case against suspected underworld kingpin Modack.
