The City of Cape Town has obtained a “final” interdict which prevents people residing at the old Woodstock Hospital from erecting or extending any structures or bringing furniture onto the premises. In a statement, Mayco member for human settlements Malusi Booi said: “On Wednesday 30 January, the City of Cape Town obtained a final interdict against further illegal occupation of the Woodstock Hospital site.” Known to its 490-odd occupants as Cissie Gool House, the shelter’s residents are somewhat satisfied with the order. “The order is one that, in a significant way, left some people with a little more security about the occupation of the premises,” Bevil Lucas, one of the house leaders at Cissie Gool House, said. “This gives people the opportunity to be more settled, but it also allows engagement between the City Council and us.” Lucas said the occupation of the premises might be illegal, but it reflects the housing crisis in the City of Cape Town. The City was considering a way forward.
