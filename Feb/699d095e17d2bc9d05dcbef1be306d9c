Winde, who currently serves as Community Safety MEC in the Western Cape, says provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula referred a request for an investigation into undue promotions in the Western Cape South African Police Service to "his Pretoria bosses". This, according to Winde, is unacceptable. "It is unacceptable that the head of the police in a province is disempowered when it comes to investigating allegations on his turf," said Winde. "The local authority is best placed to ensure this and this is why I will fight for the decentralisation of the police service."

The matter has thus been directed to the office of the National Commissioner for the necessary attention." "The provincial commissioner should determine who should be promoted and if it is deserved," Winde said. "If we are to eradicate crime, we deserve policing that is qualified, experienced, transparent, honest, sincere, well-functioning and competent. "I am hopeful that this matter will receive the urgent attention it deserves, as we cannot have incompetent, unqualified, inexperienced individuals in leadership positions just because of their political stance," Winde further stated.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
