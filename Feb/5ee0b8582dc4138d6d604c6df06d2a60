He had always 
maintained his innocence but Craig Coley, 71, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for 
the 1978 murder of his former partner, Rhonda Wicht, and her 4-year-old 
son, Donald. He was finally pardoned in 2017, based on exculpatory DNA evidence found by 
investigators, and reached a $21m (about R290m) settlement. "While no amount of money can make up for what 
happened to Mr. Coley, settling this case is the right thing to do for 
Mr. Coley and our community," Simi Valley city manager Eric Levitt said.
