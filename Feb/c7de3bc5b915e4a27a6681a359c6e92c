The 33-year-old man, who was employed by the SGB, was arrested last month after a 17-year-old pupil at the school and her mother opened a sexual offences case. He appeared in the Alexandra Regional Court shortly after his arrest and was suspended by the school. News24 previously reported that at least three female pupils had come forward with allegations against him.The alleged incidents of sexual assault were said to have taken place throughout 2017 and 2018, during netball matches and on school outings. A parent of one of the complainants confirmed this to News24. The man's name is known to News24 but cannot be disclosed until he has pleaded. He also faces allegations of financial mismanagement. It's alleged the man failed to deposit money he had received from pupils and parents into the school's bank account. The hearing starts on February 6. In a statement, the SGB says it moved the start of the hearing from February 5 "to accommodate the availability of all parties". The hearing is expected to conclude on February 7. The body also notes that the hearing will be held at "an undisclosed location to protect the identities of the affected pupils and to allow for normal learning activities to continue at Bryanston High School". The coach is expected to return to court on March 12. ALSO READ: Child sexual abuse and exploitation: 10 things a new study found   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
