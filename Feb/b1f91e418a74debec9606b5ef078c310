"She will be facing the charges of attempted murder after a newborn baby was found in a drain at Newlands," Mbhele said. She said once the woman was declared fit, she would appear in court. Soon after her rescue, the infant, dubbed a "miracle baby", was taken to Chief Albert Luthuli Hospital where she was treated. On arrival, she was said to have been in good health. "She has been awake, responsive and crying. Her glucose and sugar levels are good. She is stable enough for [a] transfer to base hospital so the social aspect can be sorted," Dr Timothy Hardcastle told journalists who were at the hospital shortly after the child's rescue. On arrival at the hospital, it was said that the biggest challenge was her temperature.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
