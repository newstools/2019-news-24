Pitbulls and their owners came from all over Cape Town to attend the Enduro Pits show at Parow High School on Saturday 23 February. The dogs competed in events which included high jump, long hang, wall climb and conformation. Ulrich Houtzamer, from Athlone, says they are trying to create a positive image for pitbulls. “We do all of this for positivity because these dogs are so misunderstood. We want to show everyone that pitbulls are not monsters,” he says. Olando Jacobs from Fairways says they want to create awareness because many of these dogs are used for the wrong reasons – especially in the poorer communities. “We want to show dog owners how to handle these dogs, how to look after them and how to breed responsibly,” he says. The top three winners of the day: Ulrich’s Frodo (best in show), Sufiyaan’s Doutjie (best puppy) and Zara’s Hunybunch (best opposite).
