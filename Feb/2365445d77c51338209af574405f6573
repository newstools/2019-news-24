In a communiqué to students, the university said executive management decided to suspend the academic programme. Lectures are earmarked to begin next Monday. "This suspension will allow management the space to continue to engage the student leadership and deal with issues raised. Other operations of the university will continue as normal," read the e-mail to students on Wednesday. The protest is in response to a provincial call to shut down universities following students' demand for free, quality education. Central SRC secretary general at UKZN, Siyabonga Khumalo, previously said financial exclusion was a running theme for the protests. "Students must pay 50% of money [they owe in order] to register. We are saying this is not possible. It's hard for people to come up with that much money at this time of year."
