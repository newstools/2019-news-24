The 30-year-old was arrested in his room in the Umlazi hostel and had been linked to multiple hostel murders, police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said. The assailant's luck came to an end after he was arrested for the murder of 52-year-old Thabani Mjoli who was found dead in his room with multiple gunshot wounds, a month ago. "The suspect was sought for a number of murder incidents. He has been linked to other murders that occurred at the hostel and KwaMnyandu, where four people were killed in separate incidents," Mbele said. She said he was being profiled to determine if he could also be linked to other pending serious and violent cases.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
