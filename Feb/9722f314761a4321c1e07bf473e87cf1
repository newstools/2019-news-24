Garrith Jamieson of Rescue Care said that the drowning incident happened just after 14:30. "Rescue Care paramedics and the SAPS (SA Police Service) Search and Rescue teams arrived on the scene to find lifeguards attempting to resuscitate the two gentlemen," said Jamieson. "Unfortunately, the resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful and the men were declared dead on the scene by paramedics," he added. The third man was stabilised and the emergency services helicopter transported him to hospital. The events leading up to the drowning are unknown, but police will investigate further. In December, two children drowned in two separate incidents in KwaZulu-Natal. The one, a 16-year-old boy, drowned at Meerensee Beach in Richards Bay. The teenager had been reported missing before emergency services discovered his body submerged in the water. Earlier this year, a 29-year-old man died while trying to save a 13-year-old girl at Wolfgat Nature Reserve. News24 reported at the time that it was believed that the teen was disabled.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
