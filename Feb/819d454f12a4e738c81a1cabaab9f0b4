Police spokesperson Andre Traut said they were following up on a tip-off which led police to a residence in Starling Street where the suspect was found in possession of tik, mandrax and heroin. The suspect is expected to make a court appearance on Monday in Wynberg on drug-related charges. While on the scene, police pursued more information which led to the arrest of two female suspects, aged and 45 and 49, for being in possession of drugs with a combined value of R 30 000 in Grassy Park. They too are due to appear in court on Monday. Traut said drug and gang related crime will remain a priority for the Western Cape police and they would continue with the "onslaught to root out the scourge".    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
