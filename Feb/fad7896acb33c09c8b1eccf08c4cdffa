THE Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality is urging all its residents to make use of the municipal mobile application to ensure better service delivery in the metro. This after the municipal call centre staff, who operate the municipality’s service delivery hotline, went on a recent strike for permanent positions within the call centre. As a result of the strike, complaints about water, electricity and sanitation problems were unattended. The Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, has since promised permanent positions for the 32 call centre staff. According to the municipal spokesperson, Kupido Baron, the municipality, like any other entity, is going digital to ensure better service delivery to all residents. “The municipal mobile application could have been used during the strike of the call centre staff, but residents were not aware of it. “Even though the app was launched in 2016, not enough residents are currently using it,” Baron said. The mobile application provides direct communication with the municipality and serves as a platform through which residents are able to interact with the municipality for services and reporting of faults.
