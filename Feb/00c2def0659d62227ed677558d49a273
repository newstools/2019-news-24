Residents of Prokopyevsk feared for their health on Sunday as blackened snow allegedly caused by a local coal processing factory covered the Siberian town. Some expressed concern over children's health as playgrounds and schoolyards were covered in the dirty snow. Others suspected it could be toxic. The town is among others affected in the Siberian region of Kuzbass, which is home to 2.6 million people and one of the world's largest coal fields. Europe to the max: A night in an ice hotel Every year, the "Icehotel" has to be built again from fresh snow and ice. It's the oldest hotel of its kind in the world. Guests have been coming here since 1989 to spend a frosty night. The cause of the discolouring is allegedly coal dust that fell onto the snow from local plants processing coal. Elsewhere in the region, the towns of Kiselyovsk and Leninsk-Kuznetsky also saw coverings of dirty snow, according to local media. Prosecutors in nearby Kemerovo have reportedly started checking whether pollution standards have been breached by the coal industry. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by
