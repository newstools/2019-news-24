Two men arrested in connection with the murder of Mfuleni’s award-winning nurse Gregory Paulse appeared in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court last Friday. Paulse’s (55) corpse was found at his home in Blackheath on Wednesday 6 February. Kleinvlei police spokesperson, Captain Florina Muller, confirmed that the body of a 55-year-old man was found at his home in Blackheath on Wednesday 6 February. “The victim was stabbed at his home and his body was found by neighbours. Two suspects have been arrested and appeared in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court on charges of murder on Friday,” said Muller. Paulse has been lauded for his work within the community, having worked at the Mfuleni Community Day Centre for close to 20 years. Paulse had been repeatedly praised for going the extra-mile to visit bed-ridden patients at their homes in Mfuleni and those who were unable to visit the clinic. He was well-known within the community, often assisting families of patients who had lost their loved ones with funds for funerals, as well as providing them with food from his own pocket. Paulse’s efforts were recognised when he was nominated alongside nine other nurses for the 2016 Western Cape Cecilia Makiwane Nurse’s Recognition Award. The awards recognise the work done by local nurses, who walk the extra mile alongside their patients and embody the calling of what it means to be a nurse. Although Paulse did not win the award, he continued his selfless work within the community. “When someone comes back to thank me, I know that I have done something good. I have a passion for nursing, which is the only thing that drives me to help others. I love people,” Paulse told City Vision at the time. Family, friends and neighbours gathered outside his house on Thursday 7 February for a memorial service.
