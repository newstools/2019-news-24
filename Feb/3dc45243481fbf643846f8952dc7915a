An elderly man suffered a heart attack after a masked gunman stormed into
his shop and stole cash while threatening him with a gun. The robbery took place in the early hours of the morning in Krefeld, a city
in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. CCTV footage shows the masked robber strutting into the store, brandishing
a gun. He empties an unmanned till before approaching the elderly man and his wife
and demanding money from the cash register they're standing at. The robber then calmly walks out of the store. According to local media the 68-year-old shop owner was so shocked he
suffered a heart attack when the police arrived to quiz him about the crime. The cops successfully resuscitated the man who was then rushed to hospital. According to reports he's still in a life-threatening condition. “The incident is now our No 1 priority,” a police spokesperson said, adding
that a manhunt for the assailant has been initiated. To step up the search the police released the CCTV footage, which is
unusual in Germany -- it's normally done only if all other investigative
methods have failed to produce results. Cops believe the shop was the robber’s seventh target that night and that
he also tried to rob a casino 16 hours after the filmed robbery.
