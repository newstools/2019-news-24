"During a brazen attack on a cash-in-transit vehicle last night two of our police officers lost their lives, seven suspects were killed and a woman was wounded," said Naidu.The police's special task force (STF) and crime intelligence (CI) units were following up on intelligence regarding a planned attack on a money van when a group of heavily armed people attacked the vehicle with explosives at around 19:00 on the Hlabisa road. The police responded quickly but there was a shootout between them and the robbers. "Seven suspects, a member from CI and the STF member were killed during the skirmish. A female member who was shot in the leg is currently receiving medical treatment."  So far, four AK-47 assault rifles have been recovered. The BMW driven by the suspects was reportedly used during other robberies, including one recently at a Nongoma Shell garage. National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole conveyed his deepest condolences to families of the police officers and wished the wounded police officer a speedy recovery."This is yet another sad day for both the South African Police Service as well as South Africa at large for every time the life of a police officer is lost in combat, the nation mourns", said Sitole in a statement."I offer my highest praise to the all our colleagues that have once again put their lives on the line to bring hardened and selfish criminals to book", he said.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
