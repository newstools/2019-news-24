In a statement on Sunday, the union said the company's voluntary liquidation should not affect staff members. "They must all be absorbed by the DCS and continue doing the important work that they have been carrying out as they cannot be sacrificial lambs over an unfortunate situation not out of their own making. They will impart the necessary skills to inmates that will contribute to their rehabilitation," the union said.

This self-made dilemma should not result in any uncertainty and changes," Popcru said.
