The Western Cape education department said it established that a Grade 7 pupil had been playing with a ball at Laerskool Olifantsvallei and that the ball hit a Grade 4 child. "The Grade 4 learner, reportedly angered by this, allegedly choked the Grade 7 learner," said spokesperson Jessica Shelver. She said that, according to district officials who visited the principal, secretary, and parent of one of the pupils, a "minor" scuffle ensued between the two girls. However, later in the day the father of the Grade 4 pupil arrived and allegedly choked and kicked the 13-year-old outside the school grounds. "This is unacceptable behaviour of a parent and we will support the mother of the Grade 7 learner in laying charges against the father of the Grade 4 learner." The school has decided to take a "restorative justice" approach, instead of opting for suspension or expulsion. It is to send the pupils for counselling and has urged parents to make sure their children do not behave violently. However, the girl's mother is determined to go ahead with a police case after laying a complaint at the local police station. "I will not withdraw the charges," said her mother, who may not be identified to protect the privacy of her child. Billy Claasen, executive director of the Rural and Farmworkers Development Organisation, said he was concerned that the school had not taken the incident seriously at first. He also felt that race may have played a part in the confrontation. However, Shelver insisted that race was not a factor in the incident.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
