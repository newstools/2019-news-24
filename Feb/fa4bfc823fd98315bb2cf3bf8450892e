On Monday 14 January, Curro Foreshore welcomed its first batch of excited fresh-from-primary-school Grade 8 learners. The school is one of Curro’s tech-driven schools which sees learners using technological devices for their studies. “Things have been going great since we opened. We have had a positive response from parents and the kids. We get a lot of new learners enrolling,” Curro Foreshore’s business manager Jay Paul said. Although Curro’s policy does not allow staff to reveal the number of learners they have, Paul said they have exceeded the target of enrolments they set. The role of the school is to prepare children for the world of work post university. “By the time they get out of university, technology would have changed tremendously and as a country, we need to be ready for those changes.  What we are trying to make sure is that with what we have at the moment, we are able to expose that to the learners,” he added. The learners work on touch-screen devices that serve as laptops. This is done so that they can understand the interface of using the computer to do assignments.  The learners are also taught Robotics and how to use Microsoft Office Suite, among others things. The number of the children in a class is kept to a minimum, which allows them to get individual attention.V For more information visit https://www.curro.co.za/western-cape/curro-foreshore/   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
