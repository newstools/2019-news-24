Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said on Monday that officers responded to the shooting but when they arrived at her home, they found that she had died as a result of her injuries. EFF Western Cape secretary Banzi Dambuza said they did not want to speculate on the motive for the shooting while the matter was still under investigation. "She was a very strong person who did not back down for anything or anyone and at this stage, we don't want to say it was a politically motivated murder," Dambuza told News24. "As leadership, we are allowing the police to do their work and we are still trying to find out if it was a robbery or was she killed because of her activism in the community as a former regional structure member of the EFF," he said. No one has been arrested. Van Wyk said: "Circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation and police are following up on possible leads in an effort to bring those responsible for this act to book."   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
