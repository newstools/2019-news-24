In light of the new job scam doing the rounds on social media platforms, the City of Cape Town has issued a warning to residents to be weary. The scam involves payment for application forms and is usually advertised on Facebook or via a WhatsApp message. “The City would never charge a fee for providing applicants with application forms. Heartless criminals use advertisements on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to deceive unsuspecting and desperate job seekers. These fake advertisements urge job seekers to deposit money into a bank account in exchange for application forms for vacancies at the City of Cape Town. I’m warning residents of these scams and want to urge them not to fall for these tricks,” says Mayco member for corporate services, Sharon Cottle. Cottle says the City recently dealt with a case where two residents received a WhatsApp message advising them of so-called vacancies for cleaners at the City. She says the message advised that the application forms would be made available once they’d paid R350. “Luckily none of the residents fell prey to this scam. Still, any job seeker should note that the City doesn’t charge for application forms for vacancies at the City,” says Cottle. Cottle adds that the residents who were targeted by the fraudster contacted the City and the matter referred to the police for further investigation.It is not clear how many residents fell victim to this scam, if any. However, the residents who informed the City about it weren’t tricked – they did the right thing by contacting the City to ascertain the authenticity of the so-called ‘advert’. It happens every now and then that criminals use advertisements on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter,” says Cottle. “The City warns residents as soon as we become aware of a scam, or when it is reported to us. Any message – be it on email, WhatsApp, Facebook or Twitter – asking you to deposit money in exchange for an application form from the City should be regarded as a bogus advertisement. Most of these ‘advertisements’ target entry-level job seekers. I want to remind residents and job seekers that vacancies at the City are advertised on the City’s website, and in most newspapers,” she says. Cottle says job seekers can apply for positions online, through their website, once registered for e-services. “Once registered and activated, job seekers will be able to submit digital copies of their ID, a cover letter, qualifications and references,” she says.
