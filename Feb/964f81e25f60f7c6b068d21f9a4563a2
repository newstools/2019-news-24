It's alleged a group of five men approached the two National Security and Fire guards while they were sitting in their patrol car in Hillbrow, Johannesburg, on February 11. Police say one firearm was taken from the guards. One of the suspects was caught on CCTV camera firing several shots into the car and then reaching into it, Daily Sun reported. Captain Mavela Masondo said "intelligence driven information" had led to the arrests of the two men on Saturday. The stolen firearm was also recovered, Masondo said. He added that police were still searching for the three other men involved in the shooting. The arrested suspects were due to appear in court on Monday.
