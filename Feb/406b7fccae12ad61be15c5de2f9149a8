THERE is nothing like a drought and water restrictions to give one’s garden fatigue. But hardscaping with elements offering durability and aesthetic appeal as well as less maintenance can add new value to your property. Rather than watching lawns and flowerbeds wilt and die, many homeowners are starting to incorporate more “hardscaping” to keep their yards looking good. “In this they are following the example of many sectional title complexes, housing estates and retirement villages where the common property features a combination of hardscaping and drought-resistant indigenous plants,” says Gerhard Kotzé, MD of the RealNet estate agency group. It looks attractive, is low maintenance and does not require much watering. “The trend is being bolstered by younger homeowners who work all week and would rather not spend their weekends mowing and weeding anything except perhaps an organic veggie patch, and by older owners who are looking to reduce their home maintenance tasks.” The elements of hardscaping include everything from gazebos, pergolas, paved patios and wooden decks to decorative walls and seating areas, braais, pubs and firepits. In general, home and stand sizes are also getting smaller, and prospective buyers definitely favour properties where the owners have used hardscaping to turn outdoor spaces into additional ‘rooms’. “Given the current buyer demand for easy-care homes with attractive entertainment spaces, we would also say that well-executed hardscaping projects are currently among the best home improvement options when it comes to return on investment,” said Kotze.– ISSUED: REALNET
