in two car accidents in Limpopo and Johannesburg over the weekend. On Saturday at about 17:00, a bakkie and a car collided on
the R71 near Letsitele in Limpopo. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said the
bakkie was on its roof when paramedics arrived and both vehicles were seriously
damaged. Four people, two women and two men, were trapped inside the
bakkie, and five others were found inside the car. "Paramedics assessed the patients and found that the
two women and one man from the bakkie, as well as two others from the light
motor vehicle had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life.
Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead," Meiring said. The fourth patient from the bakkie, a man, was trapped
inside the vehicle and was in a critical condition. Another critically injured
man was found inside the car, he said. Rescue services worked for several hours, using
"specialised equipment" to free them. Paramedics performed "advanced life support
interventions" on the men. They were both taken to hospital but one was
declared dead on arrival. "Two other patients from the light motor vehicle were
assessed and found to have sustained moderate injuries. They were treated and
thereafter transported to a nearby hospital." The details surrounding the incident were not yet known.
Local authorities were investigating.
