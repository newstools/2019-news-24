The Anti-Gang Unit had been transporting a prisoner to the local magistrate's court when they recognised the driver of the vehicle as someone "known to have links with a local gang in the area", said Western Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel André Traut. He said the man's female passenger was making an appearance in court for drug dealing. The court is about 100 metres away from the police station. "The driver, on noting the police, attempted to evade the SAPS members by reversing down the street. The members forced the vehicle to stop and proceeded with a search of the car," said Traut. "In the rear of the vehicle, they discovered a plastic bag containing 104 mandrax tablets, five large sticks of compressed dagga and three packets of tik." Two cellphones wrapped in plastic were found in sealed 1kg packets of sugar and maize meal, according to police. In addition, three cellphone sim cards were found in two packets of tobacco and earphones, cellphone cables and a large amount of cash were recovered. Traut said the man, aged 48, and woman, aged 23, who both live in Hillview, Blue Downs, were arrested on charges of dealing in narcotics. They are to appear in court soon.
