Who can forget that time the Guptas flew a private
plane into Waterkloof military base, for the first time really bringing the South
African public’s attention to what would later be called Guptagate. Last week, Gupta brothers Ajay and Atul hosted a
swanky double wedding for their two sons. The wedding, which came with an estimated R415-million
price tag, was held in Auli, a luxury ski resort in India’s Himalayas. But it seems they got their money’s worth, as the
wedding celebrations lasted for five days, The
Economic Times reports. On Thursday 20 June Ajay’s son Suryakant married
Kritika, the daughter of diamond magnate Suresh Signal. Atul’s son Shashank married Shivangi, the daughter of
Dubai property developer Vishal Jalan, on Saturday 22 June. Guests included the who’s who of Indian society,
including politicians, singers, models, actors and TV presenters. The guests
were transported by helicopters to the resort, which is high in the mountains,
while the flowers were reportedly specially imported from Switzerland. Yogi Ramdev was flown in for the five days and guests
could join in his yoga classes. A post shared by Abhijeet Sawant (@abhijeetsawant73) on Jun 22, 2019 at 8:44am PDT  But the proceedings, which were held in an
ecologically sensitive meadow in the mountains, raised concern from ecological
activists, the Indian
Express reports. According to the locals, a lot of plastic – bags, bottles
and so forth – was left behind in the meadow, The
Economic Times writes. The Gupta wedding in 2013 which drew South Africans’
attention was a lavish affair held in luxury resort Sun City in North West. The
Guptas allegedly still owe the resort a lot of money for those celebrations,
also a double wedding, Times
Live reported in February this year. Sources: The
