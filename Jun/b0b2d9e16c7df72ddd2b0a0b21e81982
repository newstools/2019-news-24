Actor and comedian Kenneth Nkosi is a free man following his arrest on common assault charges on Wednesday. The Abo Mama actor was charged with common assault after allegedly beating his girlfriend up at the BlackAnt Lounge in Newtown, Johannesburg last weekend. Speaking to DRUM, Johannesburg Central SAPS spokesperson, Xoli Mbele confirmed that the actor handed himself over to the police on Wednesday and was arrested until Thursday when he was due to appear at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s court. But according to the NPA, the actor did not appear in court as the charges against him were dropped by the prosecuting authority. “Kenneth Nkosi did not appear in court because the NPA refused to enroll the matter as there were no prospects of a successful prosecution,” NPA spokesperson, Phindi Mjonondwane told DRUM. However, the accuser Mosidi Motsau, who opened the case against the actor said that she was not aware that the charges against him were dropped by the NPA. “I am not aware of any charges being dropped because I do not plan to drop them,” she said before explaining that she believed the actor was out on bail as evidence was being collected. “As far as I know, he couldn’t appear in court because of a lack of evidence but the police said they were collecting evidence against him and he is currently out on bail.” Motsau also told DRUM that she would continue fighting the matter until justice was served and was appreciative of the social media support she was receiving. Attempts by Drum to contact Kenneth Nkosi were unsuccessful at the time of publishing.
