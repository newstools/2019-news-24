A KwaZulu-Natal man was sentenced to life in prison after the Nkandla Regional Court convicted him of raping a mentally handicapped woman, police said on Thursday. Thandolwenkosi Magwaza, 35, had raped the 26-year-old in Mthungwini, Ekombe, in September 2014. He was sentenced on Wednesday. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the woman was returning home from a local shop on September 12, 2014, when Magwaza, who was hiding in nearby shrubbery, attacked her. "He overpowered and raped her. After he left the scene, the victim went home and reported the rape to her mother. Ekombe police were informed and a case of rape was opened for investigation." Mbele said the Eshowe Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit arrested Magwaza three days later. "Following an intense investigation by experienced detectives, a successful conviction and sentence was handed down by the court."
