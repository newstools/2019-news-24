Now here’s something you wouldn’t want to wake up to in the middle of the night. Mary Wischhusen, from Clearwater in Florida, heard a cacophony at 3:30am. When she got out of bed to check what had made the racket, she found a 3m-long alligator in her kitchen. “I heard this huge, monstrous crash, like the whole roof was falling in on the side of my house,” she told Fox 13 Tampa. “I headed for the kitchen and as I got to the door of the kitchen, I had this beautiful face staring at me as though he belonged there. This 11-foot gator was having a marvelous time sitting in my kitchen.” Mary’s intruder had knocked over her bar stools and pretty much anything else in its way. According to housebeautiful.com, 10 police officers and two trappers arrived at Mary’s home after she called 911. The team spent two hours trying to wheedle the reptile out. Fortunately Mary wasn’t hurt in the incident – but she’s bummed that the gator smashed her bottles of red wine, or “the good stuff” as she calls it.  How did she manage to remain calm while a hazardous reptile slithered around her kitchen floor? Mary credits it to her 55 years as a nurse. “I think after all these years, if you’ve been a nurse this long, you’ve seen everything. He was just added to the book that I need to write,” she said. “It’s just amazing.”  The 77-year-old also revealed she resorted to computer games to help ease any anxiety she had, Sky News adds. “I decided I wasn’t staying there, so I went back to my bedroom and closed the door and called the police. I was hyperventilating a little, so I went on the computer and played games to settle down.” SOURCES: Sky News, Fox 13 Tampa, housebeautiful.com
