Chief Pilot Vusi Khumalo is still on cloud nine. His team gave a show-stopping aerial performance at the presidential inauguration last month. Khumalo, who has more than 30 years of aviation experience, said they had spent more than a month preparing for the showcase event. The team consisted of seven pilots, who flew two AirbusÂ A340-600s. The commercial jetliner is a four-engine aeroplane, that is 75.6m long and 70m high. And ideally it can take about 375 passengers.
