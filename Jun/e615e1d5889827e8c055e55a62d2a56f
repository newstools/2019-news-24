ARCHERY is the ideal sport for learners that do not like contact sports. It also is a highly disciplined sport that develops the archer’s cognitive and muscular ability. National Archery in Schools Programme, shortly named NASP, is growing in the Eastern Cape. Archers from numerous schools in Uitenhage and Despatch are participating in this programme. Daniel Pienaar THS has acknowledged it as a school sport and an archer from Brandwag was the Girls National Champion in 2018. Schools in East Londen, Port Alfred, Graaff Reinet as well as Jeffreys Bay have also started with the NASP programme. “With the assistance of the Department of Sport and Recreation, NASP SA received funds which were used to acquire equipment in order to develop the sport in the Eastern Cape,” said Chris Oelofse, NASP representative in the Eastern Cape. “One school that benefited from this was Bergsig School in Uitenhage. Equipment was handed over to the school for participation in the NASP programme.” One of the teachers, Celéste Smith, has been trained as basic instructor for archery. The deputy head girl, Kayla Parkin, already is an active archer. “Every month there is a competition scheduled at one of these centres. “During these competitions archers compete to build up their average score in order to be elected for the Eastern Cape Provincial NASP team. “Although archers may belong to a club, at these competitions they represent their school,” said Oelofse. NASP SA has a development programme throughout the country where archers from previously disadvantaged groups are developed through local schools/clubs, provincial level up to national level.
