Employees at the Westway Office Park in Durban had their lunch hour interrupted when they stumbled onto two black mambas fighting earlier this month. The snakes were intertwined on the road just in front of the office park. Nick Evans, owner of KwaZulu-Natal Amphibian and Reptile Conservation, was called to intervene. The 25-year-old said the snakes were probably two males wrestling for a female snake’s affections. However, by the time Evans arrived on the scene, the snakes had already separated and slithered into a nearby garden. "I wish they had called me a bit sooner," Evans told News24. He said, once the snakes slither into bushy terrain, they become difficult to find and catch. It took him almost an hour (with the help of his wife Joelle) to capture one of the reptiles. The snake was about 2.3m long. Evans said that, if people encountered black mambas, they shouldn’t be afraid. "Black mambas aren’t these evil monsters, as they have been portrayed. You leave them alone, they will leave you alone."
