An American dad
tragically died just hours before Father’s Day while trying to save his
three-year-old son, who fell into a lake. Christopher Schultz
(31) from Minnesota, US, jumped into a lake when his three-year-old son slipped
through bridge railings on Saturday 15 June in Detroit Lakes, People
reports. "The little boy
was leaning over the railing when he saw a fish and went over," said Sheriff
Todd Glander from the Becker County Sherriff’s Office. According to the sheriff's
office, the dad struggled to keep afloat while keeping his son above water. Bystanders then rushed
to the scene and managed to grab the toddler from the father’s hands and took
the boy to shore, Inside
Edition reports. Unfortunately,
Christopher failed to resurface. After 40 minutes of
searching the lake, rescue divers found the dad’s body and rushed him to St
Mary’s Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The baby boy was
treated for non-life threatening injuries and is expected to make a full
recovery, The
Sun reports. Christopher’s devasted
family have set up a GoFundMe page
to help cover the father’s funeral costs. “I worked with him and
got to know him very well,” a co-worker wrote on the page. “I'm sorry we lost
touch. We'd have our lunch together and he would always talk about his kids and
how much he loved them. I'll miss you, Chris.” “Great Father. A hero.
A Great Friend. He helped me through a tuff time in my life by being a friend
to vent to and helped me in so many ways deal with the emotional stress of my
custody battle (sic). I will be forever grateful. Our community lost a good man,”
