Protesting on the N2 outside Cape Town resulted in the highway being closed between the R300 and Duinefontein Road on Tuesday night, City of Cape Town traffic officials have confirmed. A Golden Arrow bus was burning on the inbound lane before the R300 while tyres were alight on the outbound lanes, spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhout confirmed to News24 at 20:00. No injuries were reported, she said. Tyres were also burning at the corner of Govan Mbeki Road and Symphony Way in Philippi in a separate protest, Bezuidenhout said. Police were at the scene. Tuesday was the second consecutive day that traffic on the highway was disrupted. An articulated truck was allegedly petrol bombed on the N2 in Somerset West on Monday, resulting in its closure. The truck had not been carrying any cargo at the time. The driver escaped unscathed.
