A 28-year-old man has been arrested for the alleged rape of his mother, Eastern Cape police said on Saturday. The suspect was arrested on Saturday after his mom, 50, identified him as the alleged perpetrator. "It is alleged that the victim was [walking] from a local tavern at Phaphasini Locality, Mboya Village, Willowvale on Friday at about 19:00," police spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha said. "She was on her way home. The victim felt some footsteps from behind. She continued walking until the person from behind grabbed her. She was dragged far from the road and the suspect accosted her. She was then raped by the suspect." The suspect took flight after the alleged rape, but was later identified by the victim as her own biological son. He will appear before the Willowvale Magistrate's Court on Monday on a charge of rape. "Butterworth Cluster Commander Brigadier Ngangema Xakavu strongly condemned the alleged rape of the victim especially by the suspect who was supposed to protect her as his mother," Manatha added. Xakavu congratulated Willowvale Police for their swift and speedy work in arresting the suspect.
