Judgment in the Sadia SukhrajÂ murder trial is expected to be delivered in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Durban on Monday - just over a year after the 9-year-old girl's death. It is alleged that Sibonelo Mkhize killed Sukhraj during a botched hijacking in Shallcross, Chatsworth, in Durban on May 28, 2018. He pleaded not guilty to murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. Mkhize's alleged accomplice, Siyabonga Bulose, was killed while fleeing from the scene. On the day of the incident, the two allegedly demanded car keys from Sadia's father, well-known Pastor Shailendra Sukhraj, at gunpoint. Sukhraj threw the keys at them and while both were fleeing the scene with Sadia inside the vehicle, Shalendra pulled out his licensed firearm and fired several gunshots towards the driver.The Grade 4 pupil at Everest Primary was shot in her abdomen and was taken to Chatsmed Hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.Her cause of death was a gunshot wound to the chest. Bulose died immediately after the car came to a stop. His cause of death was described as a penetrating gunshot wound to the pelvis. Sadia's death sparked massive public outcry over crime in Chatsworth. An off-duty police officer arrested Mkhize a short distance from Sadia's grandparents' home.
