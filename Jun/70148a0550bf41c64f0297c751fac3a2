Strong words were aimed at parents during the memorial service for 16-year-old Daniel Bakwela at Forest High School in Johannesburg on Tuesday. Fellow pupil, Mohammed Mwela, 19, allegedly stabbed Bakwela last Monday. Representative Council of Learners president Nobuhle Mashinini told the packed hall in Turffontein that if parents were always concerned, like they were when there was a violent death at a school, then tragedies like the one outside Forest High School could be avoided. "Parents, are you truly doing your job as you claim to? Do you sit down with your child from a young age and teach them the wrong and right, or do you let them grow and allow the world to teach them? "This world is destroying the youth and parents choose to do nothing and only act when such incidents happen," Mashinini said.
