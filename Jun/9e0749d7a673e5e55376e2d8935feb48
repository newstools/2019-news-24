South Africans have dug deep into their pockets to repay Cape Town petrol attendant Nkosikho Mbele for an act of kindness toward a customer in need. The 28-year-old helped Monet van Deventer with a mere R100 for petrol at his workplace on the N2 near Makhaza on Thursday. Van Deventer had stopped to fill up her car when she realised that she had left her bank card at home. She said Mbele then told her: "Ma'am you can't run out of petrol on the N2. I'll throw in R100 and then you can just bring back my R100 whenever you are near again." Van Deventer returned later that same day, giving him an extra R50 and a chocolate as thanks. She then started a BackaBuddy fundraising campaign for him, which has garnered more than R440 000 by Monday evening. BackaBuddy told News24 that Mbele indicated to them that he feared for his life following widespread coverage of the funds that would come his way and that, following his request, BackaBuddy would administer the funds on his behalf.
