The death in a car accident of two brothers didn't only devastate their parents – it's also plunged an entire community into mourning. On Monday morning HC (21) and Stephan de Bruyn (23), from Hoopstad in the Free State, had been driving the 25km from the family game farm to their parents' home on another farm when their bakkie rolled. Both young men died on impact. Their parents, Herman and Charleen, are utterly devastated, says Pieter Möller, a close friend of the family. "It's an incredibly hard blow to them and no one has really had any contact with them so far. "Those were their only children," Pieter says. Herman is a beloved figure in Hoopstad and the wider farming community, according to Pieter. "He's always been a leader and a father figure to many people. The town and community are heart-broken over their huge loss."  Pieter has known the two brothers since they were little boys. He says they were outgoing young men who've always had a deep love for nature and animals. "They'd been planning on taking over their dad's game farm someday." Both men had matriculated at Grey College in Bloemfontein. Stephan had been farming with his dad and HC was studying veterinary science in Namibia.  "Everywhere they went, people warmed to them. They were two beloved young men. "HC had only been in Namibia for six months but many people are flying from there for the funeral." The funeral takes place on Saturday at 11:00 in the Dutch Reformed Church in Hoopstad.
