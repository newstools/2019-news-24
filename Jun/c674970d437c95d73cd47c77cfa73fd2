The Woodstock police ask residents to be careful while crossing the bridge on Lower Church Street as this is a hotspot for muggings. Two incidents, close to the Albert Road intersection were reported recently says police spokesperson Warrant Officer Hilton Malila. He said no injuries were reported. Malila advised residents to be on the lookout for any suspicious people when crossing the bridge, especially during peak hours. He says between 06:00 and 08:00 and from 18:00 until 20:00 people should be extra vigilant because it is dark and the area is not well lit. According to him, police have, during the last few months, increased visibility in the area that pedestrians use to and from work. Previous records indicated that street robberies are common and that is why they have increased visibility around the railway environments and taxi routes, Malila said. “Since the implementation of this strategy fewer incidents were reported,” he explained. Malila encouraged victims of the muggings on the bridge to report all incidents to the police so that police officers can be deployed. He also urged businesses and residents to report faulty street lights directly to the City of Cape Town as this compromises the safety of the residents. Chairperson of the Community Policing Forum (CPF) Youssef Kanouni said they were working with the station’s management and other community safety structures to curb crime. “I can say that since the implementation of these early morning patrols, there have definitely been a fewer street robberies,” Kanouni said. He said because criminals know that lights on the bridge do not work, they tend to take chances and rob people. Malila listed the following safety tips that residents can follow in to stay safe: . When using the bridge in the mornings and evenings, always walk in pairs; . Do not openly display your cellphones; . Do not engage in cellphone calls when walking over the bridge when it is dark; . Avoid talking to strangers.
