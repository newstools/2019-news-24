The Franschhoek Pass in the Western Cape is still closed following a rock slide on Saturday morning, when a motorist narrowly escaped serious injury after massive boulders rained down on his car. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said the road would remain closed "until further notice". Inclement weather descended on the Western Cape on Friday and Saturday leaving some buildings damaged and several trees uprooted, while on the R321 between Grabouw and Villersdorp the road was closed after it was covered in sand. A tree blown over by strong winds was also removed. News24 previously reported that 28-year-old Marc Thackwray suffered only bumps and bruises after massive boulders fell on his car. Photos supplied on Saturday showed it had a crumpled bonnet and dented roof. Thackwray, who was travelling with his stepfather at the time of the incident, told News24 that "it all happened so fast". As the boulders came raining down, he realised they were in grave danger. He sprained his leg, has a swollen hand and is currently recuperating at his sister Samantha's home following a medical check-up.
