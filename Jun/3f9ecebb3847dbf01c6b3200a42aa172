 A 32-year-old Verulam man who allegedly stole a grass cutting machine is in a serious condition in hospital after angry residents doused him with petrol and set him alight. Private security company Reaction Unit SA (RUSA) spokesperson Prem Balram said the man had sustained burns to more than 90% of his body. Balram said that, when his officers arrived at the scene on Tottenham Road in Parkgate, Verulam, on Thursday morning, they found the man collapsed on the ground. He claimed the man had admitted to stealing the grass cutting equipment from contractors working on the roadside in the area. Together with the community, the workers pursued and apprehended him at the Ottawa/R102 intersection.
