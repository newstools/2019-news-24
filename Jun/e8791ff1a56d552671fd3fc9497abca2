One person was killed during a shootout on Friday after police foiled an attempted cash-in-transit heist at Evaton Mall in Johannesburg. A multidisciplinary team arrested eight suspected robbers after it spotted five vehicles with false number plates in the area, national police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili said. "A chase ensued between the suspects and the multidisciplinary team, which led to a shootout. As a result, eight suspects were arrested, and one male suspect died after one of the vehicles caught fire after crashing into a house in Sebokeng. Two suspects were taken to hospital under police guard," she added. Two R5 rifles and three magazines were recovered, as well as five vehicles. National police commissioner General Khehla John Sitole lauded the officers for the arrests. "I am pleased that members continue to thwart these heinous crimes and to bring perpetrators to book. We are indeed making great strides in stabilising heist-related crimes." Police are still searching for five other suspects.
