Northern Cape police have arrested a man in connection with the grim discovery of a teenager's body. The 16-year-old girl was found half naked in a veld with her throat slit near her home in Breipaal, Douglas, on Thursday morning. Jolandre Tolli went missing at the beginning of the month. At the time of her disappearance, police said she was last seen at a local tavern in Douglas, situated between the Orange and Vaal Rivers in the Northern Cape. "A 29-year-old man was taken in for questioning [for the murder]," said police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Dimakatso Mooi in a statement. Mooi confirmed that a case of murder had been opened for investigation. Police discovered the body of the Grade 11 Weslaan High School pupil on Thursday morning. IOL reported that her body was discovered by two elderly women who were collecting wood around 07:00, "over a 100m from where she lived with her mother". The publication further reported that the man arrested was pointed out by residents shortly after the discovery of Tolli’s body. While the man remains in police custody, Mooi said police were still appealing to anyone who may have information about the murder to contact Sergeant Jacobus April on 0823019978 or Crime Stop on 086 00 10 111.
