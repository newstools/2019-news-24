The member of the mayoral committee (MMC) responsible for health and social development in the City of Johannesburg will be visiting a preschool in Westdene, where two pupils died after allegedly ingesting rat poison. According to a statement from the City, the two were under the care and supervision of a privately-run preschool when the incident occurred. The preschool allegedly does not have the necessary permits to operate. The MMC, Dr Mpho Phalatse, is expected to visit the families of the dead children as well as the preschool. He will also talk to the police to get to the bottom of the two deaths.
