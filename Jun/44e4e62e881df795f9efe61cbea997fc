A Sophiatown police officer has been arrested in connection with the murder trial of Westbury gang leader Leroy Brown, also known as Finch. This as the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court continues to hear the bail application of Brown, who isÂ believed to be the leader of the Varados gang. He is appearing with his co-accused Christopher Charles. The two alleged gang members are facing charges of murder, attempted murder, and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. "I can confirm that a 47-year police officer was arrested for attempted murder and murder cases," police spokesperson Kay Makhubele said.

He is expected to appear in court on Tuesday and the matter is now before the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), he said. The appearance of Brown in court comes as his alleged rival gang leader, Keenan Ebrahim, also appears on murder charges. Brown and Charles' bail applications continue on Thursday.

"The police vehicle then stopped out of sight and, as they looked up, the two Varador gang members who were in the police vehicle came toward them. Both suspects were armed with handguns and started shooting at the victims," he said. Reagan Jacobs died at the scene and the other victim was wounded.
