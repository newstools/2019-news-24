QUICK reactions from an ADT Community Information Centre (CIC) worker saved the life of an abandoned newborn baby, who had been discovered in Port Elizabeth late on June 9. “Oswell October was on duty when he received a call from a distressed member of the community, describing how they had discovered a newborn baby in a plastic bag on a sports field in Windvogel,” said Ryan Britz, Port Elizabeth branch manager at Fidelity ADT. “Realising the severity of the situation, October immediately contacted local police and emergency services, who rushed to the baby’s aid. The child was thankfully found alive, and was transported to a care centre in the area.” Britz says the key in any emergency is knowing who to contact and making that call without wasting time. “The CIC was set up at our Fidelity ADT offices in PE three years ago, and it has become an essential tool which members of the community can use to report all types of emergencies. “Operators like Oswell are on duty around the clock, monitoring local CCTV camera networks as well as community social media platforms. They are also in direct contact with all law enforcement and emergency services in and around Port Elizabeth.” The CIC can be contacted on 086 121 2210 or 073 766 7447.
