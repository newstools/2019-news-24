Three people have been arrested for allegedly issuing unroadworthy vehicles with licences at testing stations across Cape Town. Two were arrested in Epping, while the other was caught in Mitchells Plain. A fourth person from Goodwood is expected to hand himself over to the police. Two licenced firearms were also confiscated by police. Arrests were made in a sting operation led by the Hawks, with the Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works on Wednesday. Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase said the operation began after an April incident where three vehicles transporting school children were declared unroadworthy. It was found that the same vehicles had been issued with roadworthy certificates just days later, without the faults being rectified. "Those three suspects were arrested and are now out on R1 500 bail each," Nkwalase said. "The suspects arrested today are linked to those unlawful certificates," he said. The roadworthy examiners have been charged with fraud and corruption and are expected to appear in the Bellville Magistrate Court on Thursday.
