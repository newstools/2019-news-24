This week on POLOTIKI we are letting President Cyril Ramaphosa say it in his own words. On Thursday evening, the president delivered his third State of the Nation Address (SONA) - his second this year and the first in the newly elected sixth administration. We shine the spotlight on three priority issues: the economy, land and corruption. Ramaphosa also shared the "dream" he has for the nation, but some opposition parties believe it is far-fetched, considering the current state of the country. SONA: Dream, dream, filling up an idle hour and 20 minutes However, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule defended it, saying "that dream is not his dream - it is the people's dream". What do you think of Ramaphosa's speech? Do you think he has put down a concrete plan to push the country forward?
