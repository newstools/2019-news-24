Gauteng police have launched a manhunt for a gang of armed robbers who killed a security guard on Saturday in Woodmead. Spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said between seven and 10 armed men stormed into Dion Wired retail store on Saturday at around 10:30 and robbed customers. "The suspects then took an undisclosed number of cellphones from the store and also robbed customers of their cellphones, rings and wrist watches. As the suspects were leaving the store, they were confronted by an ADT security guard who was responding to the scene. They then shot him on his upper body. The guard was certified dead on the scene," said Masondo. Police have launched a manhunt of the suspects who were said to be driving in four different vehicles, which included two white Toyota Corolla sedans, a Toyota bakkie and a Hyundai SUV. Police are appealing to anyone who might have information that might help to apprehend the suspects to please call the nearest police station or call crime stop number.
