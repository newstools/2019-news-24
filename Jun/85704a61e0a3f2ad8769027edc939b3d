THE Blue skies and sunshine provided ideal weather for the Little Oaks’ annual traffic day last Friday. The excitement reached a fever pitch on the morning of Traffic Day. “What parts does my bicycle have” and “why is this part here?” These were some of the questions we explored. An obstacle course had been built for the day, and everyone, from Grade RRRR to R, could try their skills in riding around cones, keeping on a straight line or weaving around a number eight. Teachers stood on the sidelines cheering, guiding and sometimes running alongside or pushing pupils on their bikes. It was a busy, happy morning, which was a lovely way to revise and practice all the traffic rules that the Little Oaks have been learning. — Supplied.
