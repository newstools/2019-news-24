Two detectives from Ocean View Police Station were applauded for going beyond the call of their duties. Detective Warrant Officer Charl Muller and Detective Sergeant Moeketsi Raphala received certificates from the City Of Cape Townâ€™s Fish Hoek sub-council on Monday 13 May. Muller was applauded for his outstanding work after he had swiftly investigated a murder and hijacking case, and thereafter arrested two suspects. Raphala was commended for the investigation of the murder of a woman in March, which led him to also swiftly arrest two suspects for the murder. All four of the suspects are still in custody. They were all denied bail and their trials are currently running. The City has recognised these officers for the extraordinary work to investigate crimes, even when it appeared that they might go unsolved. The City of Cape Town also thanked Ocean View Police Station Commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Monwabisi Buzwayo, for his excellent duties and the change he has made since arriving at the station in December 2017.
