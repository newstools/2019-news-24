Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has urged road users to exercise extreme caution this long weekend to avoid accidents. This comes after two more people were killed and about 80 others were injured in a collision involving a bus, a bakkie and an SUV on the R71 between Letsitele and Gravelotte in Limpopo on Saturday morning. Spokesperson Ayanda Allie Paine said while the exact cause of the crash is yet to be determined, Mbalula has called on road users to be careful.
