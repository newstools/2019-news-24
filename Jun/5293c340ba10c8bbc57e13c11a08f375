An American man
who was electrocuted and declared dead was brought back to life thanks to
doctors who revived him with an electric current. Michael Pruitt had
been helping his stepfather on a job home in Detroit on 30 April when the metal
ladder he was carrying hit a live wire and electrocuted him, PEOPLE
reports. “I remember being electrocuted – just shaking, and
then nothing,” Michael told reporters. The home’s owner called emergency services and
administered CPR until the local fire and rescue team arrived on the scene. Paramedics continued to give Michael CPR en route to
the local emergency room but once they arrived, hospital staff said he showed
no signs of life. “They brought in this young man who had no vital
signs,” says Dr Angel Chudler, an emergency room physician at Beaumont Hospital
in Farmington Hills “I said to my team, ‘We’re bringing him back.’ And
then I said to him, ‘You better come back!’” They used a
defibrillator on Michael but when nothing happened, dr Chudler made the call to
use a second shock with increased intensity, FOX
News reports. The second jolt
brought the 20-year-old back to life. He’d been dead for 20 minutes prior to
being resuscitated but became conscious again. Barbara Smith, director of trauma services at the
centre, explained that brain cells can begin to die in as little as five
minutes when someone goes without oxygen. “Michael’s resuscitation is miraculous. He didn’t lose
any brain function,” she explained. “It’s a testament to the importance of
immediate and continuous CPR to move oxygenated blood to the brain.” Michael is currently
at home and recovering. The only lasting injury he has are the bandages on his
big toes where the electricity exited his body. He now sports a
new tattoo over his heart to commemorate the ordeal. It shows the Eye of
Providence inside a dream catcher. Sources: PEOPLE, FOX News
