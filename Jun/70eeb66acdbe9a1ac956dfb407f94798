A KwaZulu-Natal deputy director in the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has appeared in court for alleged conspiracy to commit murder. On Wednesday, NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara told News24 that Kombisa Mbakaza had appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. Mbakaza is the head of the Sexual Offences and Community Affairs (SOCA) division in the province that deals with abuse and sexual violence cases. "I can confirm he appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court yesterday and was released on R2 000 bail." When asked whether Mbakaza had been suspended, Kara said a decision would have to be taken on it. "I cannot comment further than that." Informers told the police that Mbakaza had allegedly hired them to kill his wife, as well as a department of justice employee in the Eastern Cape. He will return to court on August 23, Kara said.
