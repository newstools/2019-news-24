*UPDATE: A group of ardent supporters of embattled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede refused to leave ANC headquarters in Durban on Tuesday, saying they demanded an audience with provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala. The group in its hundreds were camped outside the ANC KwaZulu-Natal offices by Tuesday evening. Supporters were reluctant to speak to media, but one woman said they demanded to speak to senior leadership. "We are here to ask for the regional task team to disband. We want fairness for Zandile Gumede." Rubber bullets fired Earlier on Tuesday, police and Gumede's supporters clashed outside the premises. The delegation wanted to negotiate with provincial leaders, including KZN ANC deputy chair Mike Mabuyakhulu. Gumede is currently facing corruption charges in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court, relating to a Durban Solid Waste tender. The provincial ANC recommended earlier this month that she take 30-days special leave so that the party could review her position in government. On Tuesday, her supporters were met by a solid line of Public Order Police at the entrances to the party's provincial offices. Police and ANC members can be seen yelling over each other, while some push and shove. Rubber bullets were eventually fired to disperse the crowd, but tensions remained high.
