Two of the six members of the Anti-Gang Unit who were shot this week in Samora Machel, near Nyanga in Cape Town, have been discharged from hospital, Western Cape police have confirmed. "I can confirm that one was discharged on Thursday and the other on Friday," said police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa. Potelwa said the other officers were still in hospital and that one, who was badly injured, may require additional surgery because of the nature of his injuries.

The specialised unit came under fire after apprehending a person they believed was linked to recent murders in Samora Machel. It was revealed that most of the officers suffered lower body injuries, while one was shot in the head. Police Minister Bheki Cele called the shootings "an attack on the state". An upset Cele told media earlier this week that police needed to re-strategise how they dealt with what he called "lawlessness" by criminals.
