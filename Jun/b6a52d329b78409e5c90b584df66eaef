Justice Minister Ronald Lamola will visit the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday after a gang fight brought court proceedings to a standstill on Wednesday morning. Lamola, along with court officials, will conduct an inspection at the court. The visit was scheduled for 07:00, his spokesperson, Chrispin Phiri, said. The police said they would pull out all the stops to ensure the safety of residents in a tense Westbury, News24 reported earlier. Residents called for police intervention after concerns were raised that there could be retaliations after the clash, which may cause havoc in the area.
