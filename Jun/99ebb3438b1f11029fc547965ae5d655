TWO suspects, both aged 26, were arrested by Bishopstowe Police officers on two counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder. The suspects appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court last week and were remanded into custody. On May 26, the Maphumulo family was attacked by a group of gunmen who fatally shot Kwenzi Maphumulo (29) and her two-year-old child, Melokuhle Maphumulo. Three other family members, aged between 29 and 83, sustained gunshot wounds and were taken to hospital for medical attention. A case of murder and attempted murder was opened at the Bishopstowe Police Station for investigation. KwaZulu-Natal Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said police investigations are continuing and more arrests can be expected.
