A flight scheduled to travel from Durban to
Johannesburg was delayed after a foetus was discovered  aboard at King Shaka International airport in
Durban on Friday morning. According to Flysafair, the
technical crew discovered an abandoned foetus on the aircraft upon doing final
preparations for the departure of the flight. Passengers were then asked to disembark the
plane as the relevant authorities were being alerted to initiate
investigations. “Beyond this we are unable to comment on
any specifics relating to the finding which is now a police matter. The South
African Police Service would be better poised to provide any further
information,” the statement read. Kirby Gordon, Head of Sales and
Distribution at FlySafair, said that the airline would be aiding the
authorities in their investigations and would be thanking their customers for
their loyalty. “We will be doing everything within our
power to aid authorities in the necessary investigations and thank our loyal
customers for their patience with the resultant delay.”
