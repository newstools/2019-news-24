Nicholas Taylor has been a fisherman for 20 years in the Kogelberg region, on the Western Cape's east coast. When WWF South Africa approached them about conducting scientific surveys in the area, he was anything but pleased. Fast-forward two years and Taylor is now happy they met. "In the beginning for us, as fishermen, it was a problem because we didn't know what they were doing and why they were doing certain things," he said. In 2017, WWF SA launched the project to record marine life, in partnership with small-scale fishers. The project brings together scientists and fishers to position baited underwater video cameras (BRUVs) – a rig with a camera attached to one side and a canister with bait on the other. The BRUVs are deployed in 40 different locations in and outside the marine protected areas (MPA).

He explained that the BRUVs were launched bi-annually – in summer and winter - and that it helps them understand what is happening below the water. Taylor said it had helped the fishermen to know which season and time was appropriate for catching certain species. "...it shows us how much fish is in the no-fishing zone and also outside the MPA. So, we now know what is going on under the water, because at first we would come, and there was no fish." Sigam said the data collected is put on a spreadsheet, documenting which species of fish are in a particular area, as well as their abundance. However, the information is not made public due to the fear of poachers flooding the area. The project has been expanded for five more years and surveys will now also be conducted in the Eastern Cape.
