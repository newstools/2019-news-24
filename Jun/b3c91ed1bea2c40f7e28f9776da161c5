Gunmen killed a soldier and three other people in an attack in north-central Nigeria on Tuesday, state police said. State Commissioner of Police, Isaac Akinmoyete, said the attack took place in the early hours of Tuesday in the village of Tumburok, about 30km south of Jos, the capital of Plateau State. Legislator Timothy Danton confirmed the incident in parliament, but gave the toll as five dead. According to Akinmoyete, the soldier was shot while exchanging fire with the unknown attackers. Gunmen killed 'over 130' in NW Nigeria: governor Governor of Kaduna Nasir El-Rufai says that an attack by gunmen on villages in northwest Nigeria last week claimed "over 130" lives, more than double the toll initially reported. "Three corpses were found and of course some houses were burnt. Many houses were burnt, probably 30 or 40," said Akinmoyete, adding that an investigation was underway to identify the attackers. Violence between farmers and nomadic herders is on the rise in Nigeria over access to fertile land and water, which is becoming scarce in the face of drought and rapid population growth. Plateau State is one of the hotspots for the deadly violence.
