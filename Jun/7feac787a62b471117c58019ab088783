CHILD Protection Week is commemorated annually to raise awareness about child protection and the rights of the children. This year it was commemorated nationwide between June 2 and June 9. The campaign started in 1997 to promote the rights and protection of children. The Umvoti Child Protection Forum commemorated the day in Muden, outside Greytown. Centre manager for the Umvoti Aids Centre, Dumi Magwevana, said: “[We held] an awareness campaign at Matishane Community Hall in Muden for Child Protection Week, which is the national campaign against children and women’s abuse. “Umvoti Child Protection Forum took an initiative to visit all the schools around Muden to address the challenges that our children face on a daily basis in our society. “It was a huge, long and successful campaign where Umvoti governmental and non-governmental departments came together to address pupils about their rights and responsibilities. “Our main aim of this national campaign was to equip parents, teachers and pupils [with the skills] to deal with these challenges. “We, as the Umvoti Child Protection Forum, urge all abuse victims to report any type of abuse — do not keep quiet, speak up so that you will get help and we will get rid of these perpetrators. “Stop children and women abuse,” ended Magwevana. Attending the function were representatives from Umvoti Municipality, Deputy Mayor Nomvula Masikane, ward councillors, and members of the Umvoti Child Protection Forum.
