Staff of Phatshoane Henney Attorneys has lent a helping hand to the New Beginnings Animal Rescue Centre in Bloemfontein by donating pet food and blankets. Donations support this animal welfare body in its important work to alleviate the plight of neglected and abandoned pets. The much-needed donation includes canned dog food, dog biscuits, blankets and dog jackets. Bags of 175 kg of pet food and 40 blankets all worth more than R6 000 were donated. The law firm staff made the gesture possible by teaming up. This heart-warming gesture further enables the animal welfare organisation to continue with the good work to provide care to animals. An additional amount of R2 200 was donated towards the organisationâ€™s veterinary account to assist with the large amount of veterinary expenses. The law firm staff visited the centre to hand over the items on 7 June. New Beginnings was established in 2013 and provides a haven for rescued pets needing care after being neglected and abandoned. These pets are rehabilitated with the chief objective to be adopted.
