According to police spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha, it is alleged that the woman attended a traditional ceremony at about 23:50 on Sunday in Rhaladiya, Chafutweni Village, Willowvale. According to information, the woman went outside her hut when two men grabbed her and raped her. "Fortunately, there was an eyewitness who saw what was happening.
