"There's going to be an emptiness from our side. There's someone walking out there, telling people he did it and now he's the hero, but my brother was the hero. He did his job to the best of his ability."These were the words of Carmen Jansen, sister of slain Steenberg Police Station’s Sergeant Donovan Prins.Prins was killed in the line of duty during an operation in Lavender Hill on Monday 24 June where an alleged shooting incident ensued outside 6B on Grindal Crescent, near an infamous gang warzone.Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the family at their home on Wednesday 26 June to convey his sympathy personally to Prins’ mother Rachel Prins, who had returned home from hospital. A resident who would not be named and lives in a street parallel to Grindal Avenue, said she heard a number of gunshots after 23:00 on the night of Prins’ death. She said many of her neighbours ran to the scene after it had quietened down.She also alleges that the incident was a result of the gang warfare that has ravaged the Lavender Hill community. “This is mongrel territory behind here,” she said gesturing to the street behind her residence where the incident took place.  Prins’ father, Richard Prins cut a forlorn figure during Cele’s visit, while his wife and son’s wife Shaldene consoled each other.“We don't know what to do right now. My mind is not here. He was my only son (and) we are heartsore,” says Richard Prins.Cele confirms two people have been questioned regarding the incident and they are getting direction from them.Anyone with information on any crimes is urged to please come forward and call the police or the City’s Public Emergency Communication Centre by dialing 021 480 7700 from a cellphone, or 107 from a landline.
