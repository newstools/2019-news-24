The case against a 49-year-old manager of a Cape Town orphanage, accused of fraud and corruption, has been delayed in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court, as the State finalises additional charges before a bail application can be heard. The court heard on Tuesday that the State intended to add physical and sexual abuse charges against the manager and would be ready to make its case in a week's time. The manager of Al-Noor Child and Youth Care Centre - a Cameroonian national - listened attentively as the prosecution revealed that more charges would be added onto her original charge sheet, including defeating the ends of justice. An accused can only be named in a sexual offence-related case once he or she has pleaded. "We also need to look into her bail profile and then finalise the charges," prosecutor Adiel Jansen told the court. Jansen said the State still needed to verify whether she was in the country legally before charging her with defeating the ends of justice. The defence did not take lightly to the postponement, arguing that the accused had been in custody since Friday, adding that the State had ample opportunity to complete the details to proceed with a bail application. The court granted the postponement. The manager was arrested during a sting operation by the Hawks' serious corruption investigation team and the Department of Social Development on Friday. Last Wednesday, the department removed 17 children from the facility on the back of allegations of physical and sexual abuse. It coordinated efforts to reunite the children with their "immediate family" after the centre was shut down. The woman will be back in court on June 25 for a bail application. She remains behind bars.
