A newborn baby has been rescued from a school’s pit toilet in KwaDukuza, north of Durban, after a teenage girl delivered the infant in the toilet, reports East Coast Radio. She had not known she was pregnant before giving birth. On Monday an emergency team arrived at the undisclosed high school after they were alerted by the school. “Upon arrival our emergency services broke through a concrete slab to rescue the infant who was fortunately still alive,” says KwaDukuza Municipality spokesperson Sipho Mkhize. The mother, who is a minor and thus cannot be identified, was then admitted to hospital along with the baby. “We handed the matter over to Saps officials but the mother and child were in a stable condition at the time of handover,” Mkhize adds. KZN department of education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa tells DRUM they had been made aware of the situation. “We are working on the matter and we’ve contacted the district to put us into contact with the school.” No case has been opened with police in KwaDukuza and they say the matter has been handed over to provincial level.
