A former Bitou mayor will be the chairperson of the Western Cape legislature's Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa). The DA, in a surprise move, had offered the key oversight position to the ANC last week, who accepted. On Tuesday, DA chief whip in the legislature Mireille Wenger announced that it will be Lulama Mvimbi. "The DA offered the chairpersonship of this committee to the official opposition as we believe this is in line with good democratic practice. The ANC nominated Lulama Mvimbi to the position which the DA supported," Wenger said in a statement. As a 22-year-old, Mvimbi became Plettenberg Bay's first democratically elected mayor in 1995. He remained in this position until 1998. He also served as the mayor of the Eden District Municipality from 2003 to 2006, when he was the ANC's candidate for the mayor of Bitou (formerly Plettenberg Bay). He was mayor from 2006 until 2011, when the DA won the municipality in coalition with Cope. The other committee chairpersons are all DA MPLs. They are:  "We look forward to working with members of provincial parliament to ensure transparency and accountability within the Western Cape government over the next five years," said Wenger. "I trust that as a multiparty house, the Western Cape Provincial Parliament will continue to ensure that we provide the best possible governance to the people of this province."
