He has travelled to six continents and painted in 23 countries, spreading messages of peace through his work. Now Miami-based mural artist Kyle Holbrook has made his mark on a large building in Woodstock, Cape Town. The larger-than-life characters he painted reflect the many cultures, ethnicities and religions that were captured by local photographer Tessa Gordon over the last 20 years. After seeing a mural of Holbrook's in Miami, which happened to be the largest mural in the state at the time, she insisted on a collaboration with the artist. The two have since worked on big projects together, including work for Hilary Clinton's campaign during the 2016 US elections. Kyle regrets not having planned a much longer stay in Cape Town, after falling in love with the Mother City during a few brief scenic tours. He only had three days to paint the mural and capture South African culture, despite it being his first visit to the country. "Sometimes, seeing visual representations such as this one, can be a reminder that we are all human," Holbrook told News24. WATCH: Cape fishermen turn their hands to science for underwater survey Fishers no longer have to wonder how much fish or what species swim the waters of the Kogelberg region, on the coast of the Western Cape. They now have the information at their fingertips, thanks to a collaboration launched by the WWF-SA. Recent heavy rains in Cape Town proved to be a major obstacle in completing the mural, but Holbrook plans to do some finishing touches when he returns in a few months. If you are in Cape Town, you can go see the mural in 48 Albert Road, Woodstock.  KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
