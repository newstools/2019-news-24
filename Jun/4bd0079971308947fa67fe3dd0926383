President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Friday that he had appointed 13 members to the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL). They will serve for a period of five years. The commission members are: - Prof. Luka David Mosoma (chair); - Dr Sylvia Mmamohapi Pheto (deputy chair); - Ms Sheila Khama; - Ms Tsholofelo Mosala; - Mr Sicelo Dlamini; - Dr Oscarine Nokuzola Mndende; - Ms Nomalanga Tyamzashe; - Ms Ramokone Tryphina Kgatla; - Dr Muneer Abduroaf; - Adv. Richard Botha; - Prof. Pitika Ntuli; - Mr Renier Schoeman; - Mr Mandla Langa. The CRL is a constitutional body that works to protect and promote the rights of people to freely observe and practice their culture, religion and language. Freedom of Religion South Africa executive director Michael Swain welcomed the appointments. "In a time where globally there is a serious erosion of religious freedom in multiple areas, the CRL has a critical role to play in creating an environment wherein religious communities can flourish, and religious believers can give expression to their deepest convictions and beliefs within the rule of law," he said. "As such, the commission's role should be not to control, but to enable and enhance believers' exercising of their religious rights." Ramaphosa wished the appointees well in their critical role "in ensuring social transformation and nation-building for the attainment of a truly united South African nation".
