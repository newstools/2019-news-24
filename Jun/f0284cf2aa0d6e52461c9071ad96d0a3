Brazilian Comrades runner Iago Marçal has once again got people talking, all because of his dance moves. The 26-year-old was participating in his third Comrades Marathon on Sunday when he was caught on camera doing the "gwara gwara" and the "vosho" to gqom music. Siyanda Ntenga, who shot the video, was at the Santaco water stand, 17km into the race in Pinetown, when Marçal approached. "I know him from last year, so when I saw him approaching our table, I just got my camera ready," Ntenga said. "I knew he was going to dance... he was in a jolly mood," he said.

"I just like dancing… it's my way to thank the supporters for standing there the whole day," he said to News24 on Monday.  Marçal is originally from São Paulo, but moved to Cape Town permanently two years ago. He said they had a similar style to "vosho" back home in Brazil. "I'm not a dancer… I just like the way the people in South Africa dance. It's really unique," he said. He finished the race in 11 hours and 43 minutes. "I just took my time and the main goal was to enjoy it," he added. "There's nothing like running the Comrades."
