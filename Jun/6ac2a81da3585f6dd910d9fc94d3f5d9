Gunner, a stray dog that was roaming the streets of Durban, is making a miraculous recovery after vets removed an arrow that was lodged 15cm in his body on Sunday morning. The arrow had narrowly missed one of the canine's lungs. The wounded dog was spotted outside a primary school in Verulam. Neeri Naido, the co-founder of Phoenix Animal Care & Treatment, told News24 that the injury was most likely inflicted by a pistol crossbow. It is suspected that the arrow was lodged in the dog for nearly 48 hours. Naidoo said the organisation regularly responded to calls related to animals being shot with pellet guns or catapults. Although experts originally estimated Gunner to be 12 years old, an examination found that his appearance was due to neglect and malnourishment. He is about three years old and, according to experts, Gunner has his youth to thank for the quick recovery. Phoenix Animal Care & Treatment is urging anyone with information to come forward.
