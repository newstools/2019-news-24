CHILDREN at the Greytown Child and Youth Care Centre participated in a talent competition held at the centre on May 25. The aim was to select Miss and Mr Greytown as well as to market the e-Campus. The event saw 24 models as well as singers, poets, drama performers and traditional dancers showcasing their talent. All participants were given a chance to perform on the day but the centre only had results for the models. There were four judges who were responsible for selecting the best model out of six finalists. Manager of e-Campus Nkosinathi Mbatha is willing to help unemployed youth willing to further their studies through enrolling at the e-Campus. The upcoming event will be held in Greytown on a day that will be communicated with residents in due course. Mbatha will visit the following schools next month: Sphakeme Combined, Mount Ernestina Combined, Bhambatha High, Maqhinga High, Elsie Mtshali High, Upper uMvoti Combined and Buhlebuyeza Secondary. The main aim of these events is to help people who are unemployed acquire knowledge through the e-Campus. Mbatha will also invite schools around Greytown to assist the youth. â€” Supplied.
