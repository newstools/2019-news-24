Zwane said it was alleged that the officers took bribes from motorists travelling on different routes including the N4 and R40 in December 2018 and January 2019. "The two routes are have been identified as the top hazardous routes in the country contributing a high number of fatal crashes. Mpumalanga recorded 172 fatalities during the 2018/19 festive period." "The two routes are also notorious for violations of traffic laws including overloaded of trailers, unroadworthy vehicles, unlicensed drivers and speeding." Zwane said the arrests would send a message to other law enforcement officers to desist from illegal activities when deployed on the road. "Society demands that there be no zero tolerance for fraud and corruption and the anti-corruption agencies have to act without fear or favour," Zwane concluded. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by
