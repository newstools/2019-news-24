"Unknown suspects entered the venue and shot at people who were attending a party. Two male persons were killed and one was injured, and admitted to hospital. The motive for the attack is unknown but the possibility that the incident could be gang related is not ruled out. No one has been arrested as yet" he said. The surge in gang-related violence across South Africa recently prompted Police Minister Bheki Cele to roll out the Anti-Gang Unit (AGU) countrywide. Cele announced this week that the AGU had been elevated to a national level, because "gangsterism is spreading across" the country. He made this announcement in Parliament during the State of the Nation debate this week, a day after a community activist had raised concerns that the unit had been operating without a proper budget. The AGU itself has felt the ire of Cape Town's gangs - earlier this month six members were shot and wounded while tracing suspects in Samora Machel.
