A woman who is accused of killing her four children in Klarinet, eMalahleni was denied bail in the Witbank Magistrate's Court on Monday. Magistrate Mdumiseni Mavuso said it would not be in the interests of justice to release 24-year-old Zinhle Maditla on bail, saying that such a move would "shake the public trust in the justice system". This comes after the State opposed bail and argued that there were no exceptional circumstances that would warrant her release. It is alleged that Maditla, 24, used poison to kill her children - two boys and two girls - aged 11 months to eight years, in December last year, News24 earlier reported. The incident occurred after she allegedly got into an argument with the father of two of her four children. The 24-year-old allegedly then kept their bodies in her rented room for four days before handing herself over to police. When neighbours inquired about the bad smell emanating from her room, she allegedly told them that she kept rotten meat in the room, News24 reported. The State further revealed that a psychiatric evaluation established that she was fit to stand trial.
