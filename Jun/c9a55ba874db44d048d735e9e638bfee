Sentencing proceedings of convicted taxi serial rapist, Zakaria Muyambo, 34, are expected to kick off in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Thursday. Victim statements and evidence in mitigation are expected to form part of the proceedings when they continue on Thursday. On Wednesday, Acting Judge Peet Johnson found Muyambo guilty of 27 charges, including rape, kidnapping and robbery. Background From May 2015 to October 2016, Muyambo pounced on eight female passengers who boarded his minibus in Olifantsfontein, Centurion and Gerhardsville, Atteridgeville. The 34-year-old also robbed victims of their personal belongings, such as handbags and cash after he kidnapped them. Muyambo, who has no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to the charges. In the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court in November last year, another notorious taxi serial rapist in Gauteng, Lebogang Gift Mokoena, was handed 13 life sentences and 340 additional years.
