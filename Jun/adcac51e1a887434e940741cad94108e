Nikita Naudé (15), from Kroonstad in the Free State, was last seen on Sunday night in Steynsrus. Tanya Fourie, Nikita’s aunt, says her niece had never run away from home. “She’s a normal teenager and has never been rebellious. It’s not as if she’s a party girl. She’s actually a bit of an introvert,” Tanya tells YOU. Nikita, who’s in Grade 9 at Kroonstad High School, has blonde hair and greenish eyes. She also has a birthmark on her neck. The teen lives with her mom, Ulandi Naudé, a single parent, in Kroonstad, and was visiting her grandparents in Steynsrus for the winter school holidays when she went missing, Tanya says. Nikita’s grandmother – who’s Ulandi and Tanya’s mom – recalled an unusual incident that occurred before the discovery of the teen’s disappearance. “On Sunday afternoon she (Nikita) said [to her grandmother] she was going to sit in the sun outside,” says Tanya. “When my mom went looking for her, she couldn’t immediately find her. “[Then] Nikita got out of a white hatchback Opel Corsa that was parked across the road,” Tanya says. She told her grandmother she’d been giving the man in the Corsa directions, says the distraught aunt. “My mom just said, ‘Sussie, you know you don’t just get into a car with strangers – you explain at the window.’ “She thought that was the end of that. But on Monday morning at 03:00 when my dad took their little dog out, Nikita was gone,” Tanya tells us. Tanya says when their mother called to give Ulandi the news of Nikita’s disappearance, it “was like a kick to the stomach”. “Nikita, if you see this, please let us know you’re OK – or just come home,” Tanya says, fighting back tears.  Captain Stephan Thakeng has confirmed a missing person’s case has been opened with the police. The police are looking for the white Opel Corsa hatchback. “She might be in Bloemfontein or Rustenburg,” Thakeng says. The family are asking anyone with information to call the police (10111) or go to the Pink Ladies page on Facebook.
