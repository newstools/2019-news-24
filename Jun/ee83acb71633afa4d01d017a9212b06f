Commissioner Edward Kieswetter should consider tax paying pensioners and
lighten the burden on them as far as submitting tax returns are concerned. SARS should consider the following changes. Pensioners who meet
the following criteria will not need to file tax returns or submit provisional
tax returns. - Pensioners over the age of
70, deriving income from a pension fund, a retirement fund and/or from
investments only. - Their individual income for
the year before tax is not more than R500 000; - They do not work at all. - SARS issue provisional tax
assessments to pensioners during the month of July, which will allow pensioners
to accept, contest and submit medical claims prior to SARS issuing a final
ITA34. It is easy to monitor personal income via bank statements, as banks/investment companies automatically submit annually income statements to SARS
and pensioners. This will remove the burden of Efiling, submitting provisional tax and
tax returns. It will also alleviate the burden on pensioners having to visit
SARS for support and guidance. In general, claiming medical expenditure via Efiling must be simplified
across the board by allowing all taxpayers to upload proof of medical claims
when they submit their tax returns (including Efiling) the first time around,
not afterwards on request of SARS. This will lighten the burden on SARS
personnel and save time. Taxpayers must accept that making false declarations is fraud and has
serious implications. B du Preez Cape Town
