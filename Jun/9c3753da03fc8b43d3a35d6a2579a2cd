Panyaza Lesufi is either a sinner or a saint, depending on which side of the fence you're standing. The MEC for Education in Gauteng has been on a mission to change the landscape of education in Gauteng and has gained loads of admirers and made many enemies. From integrating
Afrikaans schools, to implementing a provincial
online admission system – his department’s plans have drawn praise and
criticism from all quarters. But is there a simple fix to South Africa’s education woes?
With violence, poor results and failing infrastructure plaguing the country’s
schools, policy makers have their work cut out for them. For the next News24 FRONTLINE, News24 will a host a live
debate with Lesufi and other education experts. Join News24 editor-in-chief Adriaan Basson when he examines the education landscape with Lesufi, who will also be questioned by Prof Mary Metcalfe, an education specialist, Dr Makhosi Khoza, a former ANC MP and Paul Colditz from the Federation of School Governing Bodies.
