An elderly woman was rescued by a brave paramedic after a block of flats on Noble Road opposite the Berea Centre in Durban was engulfed by flames on Saturday, KwaZulu-Natal paramedics said. Rescue Care paramedic Ian Wessels, who rescued the woman, was returning to the abase on Saturday afternoon when he saw smoke and was flagged down by bystanders, said spokesperson Garrith Jamieson. According to Jamieson, Wessels immediately called for the Durban Fire Department to investigate. "A security guard informed him that there was a sick lady that was on the third floor (and) without any hesitation Ian, who has previous firefighting experience entered the building.
