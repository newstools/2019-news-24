Around 2 000 chickens were killed or injured when a truck transporting them overturned in Diepkloof, Johannesburg, last week. The truck, which was loaded with around 9 000 chickens, overturned at an intersection with the R553 (Golden Highway) on May 29 at about 14:00. "Apparently, the driver turned at the intersection and the load moved to one side tipping the truck over," Nazareth Appalsamy, a national senior inspector with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) farm unit, told News24. Inspectors from the National Council of Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) and Johannesburg SPCA quickly arrived on the scene. Appalsamy reminded owners and drivers transporting livestock to comply with the relevant national legislation and standards. These standards, he said, were available from the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS). "All transporters must have contingency procedures or plans in place for accidents and unforeseen circumstances. This plan must also have contact numbers for the relevant roleplayers, including all accident or disaster response teams," Appalsamy added.
