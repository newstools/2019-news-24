A Durban man is behind bars after he was nabbed for allegedly being in the possession of a police uniform, counterfeit money, a car-jamming device and an illegal firearm. According to police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele, the Durban Public Order Police Project Team as well as other units embarked in an operation in Durban on Thursday at 15:30. "The team went to one of the flats at St Andrews Street in Durban where a search was conducted. "A 9mm pistol with 11 rounds of ammunition was found [on] the suspect. A further search was conducted and [a] police uniform, car-jamming device and counterfeit amount of R6 100 was also recovered from the suspect. Mbele said a preliminary investigation was conducted at the scene and revealed that the firearm was allegedly robbed from a police official in 2016 in Durban Central. "A 36-year-old suspect was then placed under arrest on charges of possession of a firearm without a licence, possession of [a] police uniform, possession of [a] car-jamming device and possession of counterfeit money. He is expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court," Mbele said. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
