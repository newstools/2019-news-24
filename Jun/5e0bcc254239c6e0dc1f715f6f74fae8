A Cape Town orphanage manager was arrested for fraud and corruption on Friday. The 49-year old, who manages Al-Noor orphanage in Woodstock, was arrested during a sting operation by the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation team together with the Department of Social Development. According to the Hawks’ spokesperson Philani Nkwalase, during the operation, 35 children, none of whom there were records for on the premises, were found. He said the Social Development played a role in reuniting the children with their immediate families. The centre was shut down on 12 June and 17 children were removed from the building after allegations of sexual abuse, which are currently being investigated.  The suspect is expected to appear at Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday and faces charges of fraud and corruption.
