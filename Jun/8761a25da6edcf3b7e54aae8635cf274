Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has bold plans. From integrating Afrikaans schools, to implementing a provincial online admission system – his department's plans have drawn praise and criticism from all quarters. But is there a simple fix to South Africa's education woes? With violence, poor results and failing infrastructure plaguing the country's schools, policy makers have their work cut out. For the next News24 FRONTLINE, News24 will a host a live debate with Lesufi and other education experts. You’re invited to join us: July 3, 2019 at 6pm, Media Park 69 Kingsway Avenue Auckland Park. Members of the audience will have an opportunity to pose their questions to the panel. Seating is limited, so contact maria.pillay@24.com to book your spot. The event will also be livestreamed on News24 on the evening.
