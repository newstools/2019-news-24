Johannesburg SAPS has confirmed to Drum that a charge of common assault has been laid against actor Kenneth Nkosi after an incident with his alleged girlfriend in Newtown, Johannesburg. The news broke on social media after a Twitter user alleged that Nkosi beat up a woman at the BlackAnt lounge on Saturday evening.According to the user, the Mad Buddies actor assaulted an unidentified woman because she refused to give him any attention. “What I saw on Friday at BlackAnt Lounge in Newtown just after 10pm Kenneth Nkosi is an abuser, he assaulted someone I know because she refused to give him attention. Men are not used to rejection. He then followed her into the ladies restrooms... & ,” she wrote before further posting a picture that shows the injuries sustained by the alleged victim and further explaining how Kenneth even took the woman’s phone.  Speaking to DRUM, Captain Xoli Mbele from the Johannesburg Central police station confirmed that a case of common assault under domestic violence had been opened against the actor after he allegedly beat up his girlfriend. “The complainant was at the BlackAnt louge with her boyfriend  when three ladies came to attack her. Her boyfriend then pushed her, causing her to sustain injuries on her hands. He further pulled her by her hair before beating her up,” he told DRUM. Mbele further explained that the complainant and the actor were still together at the time, which is why the charges fall under domestic violence. He also said that no arrests had been made yet. The tweet prompted other users to reveal their experiences with the actor, with some claiming that they have often witnessed his abusive behavior towards women.  Attempts by DRUM to reach Kenneth Nkosi were unsuccessful at the time of publishing.
