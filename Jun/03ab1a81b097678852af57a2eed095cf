AFTER four years of not having running water i, the Willowfontein community is set to receive some relief after new water pumps were installed recently. The water pumps were officially handed over to the community on Tuesday by Msunduzi Mayor Themba Njilo. Njilo said the municipality was happy that water problems in the area have finally been resolved, adding that the project cost amounted to R1,1 million. “These pumps have already started working and most of the areas in Willowfontein now have access to running water in their taps. “For the areas that do not have access to running water as yet, it’s because there is a problem with water pipes that are leaking or blocked. “We have met with the municipal water department and we have agreed that they will visit these areas with plumbers next Monday to repair the leaking pipes and clean the blocked pipes so that everyone can have access to running water, “ he said. The mayor said that previously they had to switch off one pump in order for them to pump water properly to different places. “Now we are able to switch on both pumps at the same time without having any problems.” Njilo revealed that they are also running the same project in the Snathing area after their water pump was burned last year. The community has since been without water and they rely on water tankers to supply their needs. Njilo said this project costs R3.7 million. Willowfontein residents expressed their joy and relief at the installation. Resident Sphumulo Kunene said they are happy that the water problem is being resolved, however they will be more happy if the whole area has water. “We see a difference after this installation but there are other areas that still do not have water. The municipality has promised to come back and fix the water pipes that are causing problems in areas like Ezakhiwe, Phupha and Soweto,” said Kunene. Another resident, Zanele Zondi, said they are now waiting for the blocked pipes to be fixed next Monday.
