Gauteng police poured 630 000 litres of alcohol, which were confiscated from illegal liquor outlets, down the drain on Friday. Lieutenant General Elias Mawela, Gauteng's provincial commissioner, said the liquor was confiscated between April 2018 and March 2019. Mawela added that the police had also disposed of counterfeit goods worth over R500m earlier this year. "We want to send out a loud and strong message to illegal traders that we mean business."
