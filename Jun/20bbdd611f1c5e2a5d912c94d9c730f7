Police Minister Bheki Cele has bid farewell to 28-year-old Constable Nhlamulo Vukeya who was murdered while in the line of duty in Soweto, Gauteng. "To the Vukeya family: walk tall for your son died a hero serving and protecting the community of Moroka," Cele was quoted as saying on the SA Police Service's official twitter handle. Vukeya, who was part of the Moroka Crime Prevention unit, was on patrol at Nancefield Hostel when members stopped a suspicious vehicle, police said.    "It is reported that when the police approached the vehicle for a search, the occupants started shooting at them but the police managed to contain the situation and arrest the perpetrators," police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili previously said in a statement. "It was discovered that Constable Vukeya sustained a gunshot wound just below his bullet-resistant vest on his abdomen. "He was rushed to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. At the time of his passing he had been serving the police for just over four years." Three suspects were arrested shortly after the shooting. During the arrest, a 9mm pistol was recovered from the vehicle. The vehicle was also reported as stolen from Ectonville earlier this month.
