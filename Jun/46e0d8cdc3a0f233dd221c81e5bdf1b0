Eight people died in three separate crashes in the farming community of Rawsonville, Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said on Saturday. The accidents happened between 19:00 and 19:30 on Friday. At the Rawsonville weigh bridge around 19:00, a vehicle crossed over the white lines and collided head-on with a correctional services vehicle. Three passengers died - two in the private vehicle and one in the correctional services vehicle.

A truck and a light motor vehicle were travelling slowly in the left lane when a second articulated truck crashed into them from behind. "The light motor vehicle was then pushed into the back of the first truck... squashed like a small tin." All four women in the vehicle were killed. The driver of the second truck was rushed to hospital. Africa said that a pedestrian died in a third accident involving a single vehicle. He did not have further details.
