Western Cape education district officials believe gangs and community-related issues are to blame after two pupils were stabbed at a Mossel Bay school this week. An 18-year-old pupil at Indwe Secondary School is in a stable condition after he was stabbed in the lower back. Southern Cape police spokesperson Captain Malcom Pojie said a docket had been opened and the suspect, a 16-year-old, was facing a charge of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He has since been released and is now in the care of his parents. He is due in court on June 18.
