THE South African Police Service (SAPS) in Port Elizabeth has issued a stern warning to residents who open false cases at police stations. According to police spokesperson, Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg, criminal charges and civil claims may be opened against the perpetrator should they be exposed. “Civil claims could be instituted to recover costs involved. False reports have an impact on crime statistics and create an inaccurate account of crime. The opening of false cases is an offence and is punishable by law and will therefore not be tolerated,” Janse van Rensburg said. The Cluster Commander for Mount Road, Major General Thembisile Patekile, also warned the communities not to open false cases at police stations, as it is deemed unlawful. Patekile added, “We will not hesitate to arrest and detain those who open false cases. The cases opened are very serious allegations and require intensive investigation which entail many long hours, manpower and resources. These resources could have been fruitfully utilised in more urgent matters of policing.”
