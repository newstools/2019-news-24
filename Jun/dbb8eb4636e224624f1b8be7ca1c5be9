For a change children of Lwandle, especially those residing in the hostels, played in one place. They were not scattered around the kasi as is always the case, thanks to students from the United States of America. The students from Michigan University visited the Lwandle Migrant Labour Museum last Thursday (30 May). As is normal, after visiting the museum, the tour group was taken through the hostels to places such as Hostel 33, a provincial heritage site. They also toured around the area and the students decided to return to the area. On Sunday 2 June they brought toys and stationery for children of the area who all gathered together. They brought colouring books, crayons, hola-hoops and bubble toys. It was a fun day for the little ones as they laughed and interacted with each other and the visitors. Masa Soko, museum manager, said the students were happy to return and bring joy to little ones through their donations. “The students really enjoyed themselves when they were here and were even eating meat from the local stalls. They said they would come back as they were not prepared for their visit with the children,” she said. “Then on Sunday, we organised our local children to come and receive the toys. It was really a fun day of play for all of us.” She believes such interactions have a positive impact on both the children and the foreign students. “When visitors come to our shores, they leave very happy; that, on its own, promotes our museum and area on an international level. We are very pleased and hope everyone, even locals, can make some time and visit us,” she said. “After all we have a rich history here to tell.”
