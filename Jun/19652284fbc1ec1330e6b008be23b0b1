Shortly after President Cyril Ramaphosa told South Africans in his State of the Nation Address (SONA) that the government plans to halve violent crime over the next decade,Â Johannesburg police arrested around 150 people for crimes including murder and car hijacking. Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said the suspects were arrested in a massive intelligence-driven raid, which included Operation O Kae Molao officers. The raid took place at 22:00 on Thursday, not long after SONA had concluded. "The suspects were arrested for crimes ranging from murder, car hijacking, theft of stolen motor vehicle, house robberies and dealing in drugs," Makhubele said. He said 35 wanted suspects were nabbed on the West Rand. Meanwhile, as part of Operation O Kae Molao, police in Bekkersdal arrested 109 people, including 33 alleged illegal immigrants. According to Makhubele, "44 cellphones and gold dust were confiscated. Two cars were impounded, two firearms were recovered and two [alleged] illegal liquor outlets were closed". In addition, Benoni police arrested six alleged illegal miners. "The suspects were found with equipment used for illegal mining. Police also recovered 410kg cables of copper, suspected to be stolen," Makhubele said. The arrested suspects are expected to appear in the Westonaria and Benoni magistrates courts on Monday. This operation follows a similar one last month where, during Operation O Kae Molao, more than 130 suspects in Ekurhuleni were arrested, including one of the province's 50 most wanted people. Led by the provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela, and accompanied by then Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, the police's dragnet hooked 136 suspects, 12 of whom were nabbed on the West Rand, while six suspected illegal immigrants were detained.   - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
