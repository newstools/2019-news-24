Police have arrested a 35-year-old woman who is believed to be an accomplice involved in the abduction of a newborn baby from Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital on Thursday afternoon. "She has been detained and is currently being questioned. She will be charged and will appear in court soon," police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini told the media at a briefing outside the hospital on Friday. This comes after a woman entered the hospital during visiting hours, under the pretence that she was the newborn baby's mother-in-law. "The mother had given birth through a c-section. The suspect visited the maternity ward and started playing with the baby, before telling the nurses that she wanted to take the baby outside to show family members," Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku said. Baby wrapped in blanket The woman, however, did not return after leaving the hospital with the baby wrapped in a blanket.
