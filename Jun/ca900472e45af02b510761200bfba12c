At least 10 lions were spotted walking on a gravel road near the Palabora Mining Company's copper mine in Phalaborwa, Limpopo, on Tuesday night. A video of the pride was sent to Joe Dreyer, the editor of the Far North Bulletin, who told News24 that the lions most likely belonged to one of the surrounding nature reserves and usually stayed within the bounds of the reserve. At least once a year though, Dryer said, the pride would come close to the mine hunting for buffalo that travelled along the nearby river. "The reason we see them every year, around this time, is because of the buffalo and antelope that come here. And there aren't so many trees in the area and so the lions hunt them." According to Dryer, this specific pride had been spotted by locals for nearly 30 years. The Phalaborwa region has become famous for its lion sightings. Earlier this month, The Limpopo provincial government confirmed that another pride, which was roaming the area, had returned to their usual location.
