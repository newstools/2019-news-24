Everyone has been talking about Bradley van Sitters since he welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa in the endangered Khoekhoegowab language at the State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Thursday night. Taking to social media, many South Africans wondered what he actually said. Van Sitters, 45, a heritage activist, not only took the time to share a translation with News24, but also explained his personal experience during the "uttering". "In our culture, we use kudu horns as a symbol and instrument to connect with the people that went before us. I actually got into the moment and felt like something was working through me," he said.
