Legends Squash Club wants to share its passion for squash by providing a platform for young people to learn and play the sport. Its members started three years ago to resuscitate the legacy left by the Athlone Squash Club in 1994. Some of its players have been playing the sport for over 30 years and said they “have watched it die over the years.” The club currently has 30 members including young and old from different areas in the Cape Flats and the southern suburbs. Members say although the sport was popular then, the Turfhall Sport Complex in Belgravia, is the only remaining facility in the Cape Flats. Treasurer Marlyn Botha added: “We aim to use the vehicle of sport to create an opportunity for young and old in the community and to create a positive environment in which talent can be cultivated and grown. Our objective with this venture is not only to give an opportunity in sports but also to give them a necessary distraction from the social evils.” Clive Daries (65) is one of the oldest members in the club. He says statistics in the area show that access to squash facilities in the local community is limited and the pricing unattainable for the community. Daries says squash has many health benefits and is fun to play. It is just that the youth is no longer exposed to it. He called upon young people to give it a try and help keep the legacy alive. Nigel Diedericks, the club’s chairman, says the club wishes to build a relationship with various institutions including schools, youth care centres and residents. They say the club can accommodate children from the age of 10. They charge a membership fee of R150 monthly, but coaching sessions are free of charge.V Call Nigel on 084 630 7418 or Clive on 082 223 9399.
