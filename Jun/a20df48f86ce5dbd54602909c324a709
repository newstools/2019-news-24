The sound of a car engine may be music to the ears of motoring enthusiasts, but this weekend a Formula One car stunned fans with a melodic rendition of the South African national anthem. Some 46 000 Formula One fans flocked to the Red Bull Cape Town circuit at the Grand Parade on Sunday to experience the sight, sound and smell of a championship-winning car tearing up the cityâ€™s streets. Scotland's David Coulthard enthralled the crowd, reaching a top speed of 244km/h. ALSO READ: If Cape Town had a roof, the Renault-powered RB7 would have blown it off. LOL! SA taxi tries to take on Red Bull F1 car A local taxi attempted to 'steal' the limelight from Red Bull's Formula 1 car in Cape Town's CBD. Those who were at the Waterfront on Friday were treated to the RB7 revving the national anthem. Red Bull South Africa told News24 that there were similar fire-ups at Cape Town Station and in Camps Bay. The start-ups are done electronically. "Because of the tight clearances, the engines cannot be started from cold. Warm coolant is circulated to get the engine up to about 80 degrees and then the oil is circulated. When the engine is finally started, the engineers can control the throttle electronically and rev out almost any sequence," Red Bull South Africa said.
