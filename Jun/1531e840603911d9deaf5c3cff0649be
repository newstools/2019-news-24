Two security officers managed to fend off five would-be cash-in-transit robbers in Orange Farm, Gauteng, resulting in an arrest and the recovery of two firearms. Their armoured van had been collecting cash at a petrol station on Tuesday when they were approached by the gang, said national police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili. "The suspects managed to take cash from a security officer and shot him in the leg before taking his firearm and trying to flee the scene," she added. "The driver of the armoured vehicle noticed what was happening and pursued the suspects' vehicle, forcing it off the road until it came to a halt. The suspects were forced to abandon their vehicle and the stolen cash, fleeing the scene on foot." Police arrived on the scene and recovered an illegal firearm and the stolen cash. When they searched the surrounding area, they found one of the suspects with a rifle and arrested him. National Police commissioner General Khehla Sitole praised the bravery of the security officers. He wished the injured officer, who was taken to hospital, a speedy recovery. "The alertness and quick thinking of the driver of the armored vehicle as well as the swift response by the police to ensure that the suspect was detained is commendable," said Sithole. "We will continue to police serious and violent crimes such as cash-in-transit robberies in an integrated and multidisciplinary manner in order to alleviate the fear that these crimes instill in our communities."
