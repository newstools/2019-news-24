Murder convict Phelo Mtala, who escaped from Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on Friday 17 May, is back in police custody after police found him in Durbanville last night (Tuesday 11). According to Western Cape police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana, Mtala escaped by placing his fingerprints on the documents of another accused who was supposed to be released from Wynberg Magistrate’s Court that day. Mtala was supposed to go back to Pollsmoor Prison to attend to other High Court matters which he was already convicted on, namely: three counts of murder and three counts of possession of illegal firearm cases. Rwexana adds that extensive networking and sleepless nights by Nyanga detectives, Flying Squad officers and Provincial Operational Command Centre (POCC) resulted in the arrest of Mtala, when his car was pulled over in Durbanville while he was on his way back from Malmesbury. During the arrest, Mtala was with two women and a man. “Since he escaped from the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court the team had sleepless nights in pursuit of him. With the help of brave informers, police pounced on him last night. He is expected to appear in Wynberg Magistrates’ Court once charged for escaping in lawful custody. The other three occupants will also be charged for aiding and harbouring a convicted criminal,” says Rwexana. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula applauded the team in ensuring that this convicted criminal was re-arrested.
