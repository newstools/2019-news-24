The school of clinical medicine at the University of the Free State (UFS) has suspended the training of its students at Netcare Pelonomi Private Hospital in Bloemfontein, Free State, Times Live reported. This follows two attacks on female doctors at the hospital in the past few days. On Wednesday, a doctor at a hospital fought off an alleged would-be rapist by biting off his tongue, News24 reported. Then, on Saturday,Â a second female doctor was accosted by three armed suspects in the parking lot of the facility, EWN reported. UFS spokesperson Lacea Loader told Times Live the university would engage with the provincial Department of Health on the importance of safety at clinical platforms as a matter of urgency. Security beefed up According to EWN, Free State health department spokesperson Mondli Mvambi said security at the hospital had been beefed up. Mvambi said after Saturday morning's incident, the department was reviewing the security plan. "The security managers must then assess the plan to effect immediate interventions of continued upscaling of security. But one of the contemplations we are making is to employ services of a tactical response unit," he reportedly said. According to The Citizen, the Free State health department will meet with the management of the UFS's medical school on Monday in an attempt to divert a crisis after the university advised its students and medical interns not to report for duty at the hospital. The university reportedly sent out the notice to its students on Saturday. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
