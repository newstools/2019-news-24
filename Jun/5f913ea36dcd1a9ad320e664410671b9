The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) has made a clarion call on South Africans to become regular blood donors. Only about 1% of the country’s population of 56 million donate blood regularly. According to the SANBS, the demand for regular blood donors is big. Due to a lack of blood donors, the organisation is daily faced with the challenge of saving lives. “Donated blood is given to anyone in this country who needs a transfusion during an operation or for emergencies during childbirth,” said Jana Wallace, the head of donor relations for the Free State and Northern Cape. While the SANBS applauds its regular donors, more volunteers are needed to ensure that the target of 3 500 units per day is maintained. “This Youth Month, we are appealing to young, healthy South Africans to make donating blood a lifestyle choice.” Blood donors can visit their nearest blood donor centre, while corporates, schools, universities and community organisations can arrange blood drives.
