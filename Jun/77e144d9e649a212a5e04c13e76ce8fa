A heroic father has
tragically died after jumping in a river to save a stranger from drowning. Jacob Farley (26) from
Kansas, US, jumped in the Elk River after spotting a woman, identified as
Madison Capps, being swept underwater near the river’s dam on Friday 21 June, People
reports. When the Noel Fire Department
arrived on the scene they managed to save the woman, but Jacob unfortunately
drowned. Madison told The Miami
County Republic that both she and Jacob tried to stay afloat for 30 minutes
before the rescue team reached them, Daily
Mail reports. “I felt his hand on my
back as I tried to get on my floatie after going under,” she told Daily
Mail. “Just having him be
there next to me meant a lot. Without him there, I don’t think I would have
been able to hold on as long as I did.” “I will never forget
the sacrifice you made,” Capps wrote on Facebook on Sunday. “May your soul rest
in peace.” The young dad’s family
set up a GoFundMe
page to help pay for his funeral costs. “He didn’t think twice
about jumping in to save a complete stranger,” the GoFundMe stated. “He is a true hero and
died saving someone else’s life with no regard for his own.” “Jacob was selfless and
brave, and he lived his life the same way he lost it – helping others.” Sources: People,
