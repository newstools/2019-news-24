Police have arrested one man who is suspected to have been part of a gang who attacked a Belgian national in her Umhlanga home earlier this week. "He was travelling in a vehicle that was stolen from the home of the victim. He was nabbed in a roadblock in the Inchanga area," police spokesperson Captain Raymond Deokaran told News24 on Wednesday. Deokaran said that a firearm, thought to be stolen from the victim's home, had also been recovered during the arrest. The woman, in her 70s, was alone at home when robbers stormed her residence over the weekend.
