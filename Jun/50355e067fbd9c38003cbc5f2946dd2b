INTABA Kavuba Development Foundation (IDF) was formed earlier this year with the aim of assisting township communities, especially the development of youth in the areas of education, sport, culture as well as assisting with the stimulation of the local economy. The foundation operates in partnership with Coega CDC, Build It KwaNobuhle and the executive consists of advocate Vuyo Jack (president), Bishop L. Vaaltein, Mncedikazi Mjana, Bambo Mbityo, Mr Z. Sikwati, Mr N. Mondile, with the Ambassador to Spain, Smuts Ngonyama as a patron. “We have made some inroads through placing young people on learnerships, thanks to Build It sponsoring a first year biochemistry student at Nelson Mandela University,” said advocate Vuyo Jack. IDF will now host a Youth Summit from 28-39 June, with the theme “Creating younger and dynamic entrepreneurs and future leaders”. The foundation also requests the professional assistance from individuals and companies alike, to open their hearts by adopting schools in KwaNobuhle. With regard to voluntary service, IDF is looking for people who might be available to assist them with web design, branding, marketing and accounting.
