Two people who are accused of targeting women in Sunnyside in Tshwane are expected to remain behinds bars while police try to trace more victims. It is believed that the accused, who were arrested last week, are responsible for attacks on female pedestrians along Nelson Mandela Drive â€“ the boundary between Pretoria Central and Sunnyside. "The suspects have been linked [to] three separate street robbery attacks on women during the month of May where, among others, handbags and cellphones valued at about R32 000, were snatched from the victims," police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said in a statement.
