Three people sought in connection with a series of serious crimes committed in Randfontein and Bekkersdal in Gauteng were arrested on Tuesday night after they were allegedly found in possession of two unlicensed firearms and ammunition, as well as stolen items. Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said the people were arrested in Bekkersdal at 23:45. "The suspects are linked to cases that include robberies, car hijackings, housebreakings and house robberies. The crimes were allegedly committed in Randfontein and Bekkersdal. During the operation, police also recovered items suspected to be stolen," he said. Makhubele said police were investigating further to establish if the three people were linked to other cases. They are expected to appear in Westonaria Magistrate's Court soon. "Gauteng provincial management commended the officers for continuing to fight crime by putting the people of Gauteng first in arresting the wanted suspects. The community is urged to continue coming forth with information that can help in the fight against crime," Makhubele said.   - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
