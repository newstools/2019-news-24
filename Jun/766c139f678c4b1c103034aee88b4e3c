One person has died following a head-on collision between two vehicles on Lerome road, north of Mogwase just outside of the Pilanesberg Nature reserve on Sunday night. "ER24 paramedics arrived at midnight to find all the patients still sitting in their vehicles. Unfortunately nothing could be done for one of the male occupants who was declared dead,"Â ER24 spokesperson Ross Campbell said in a statement on Monday. Campbell said two men and two women suffered serious injuries and were taken to Moses Kotane Provincial Hospital and another private hospital in Rustenburg. He said a fifth patient who had suffered only minor injuries declined treatment and transport. The South African Police Services (SAPS) were on the scene to investigate further.
