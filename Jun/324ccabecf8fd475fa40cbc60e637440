A fisherman has died after the boat he was in, with two other people, capsized in the waves off Sandbaai and washed ashore on the south coast of the Western Cape, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said on Thursday. It is believed the three men were on a small, open rigid inflatable boat in False Bay on Tuesday afternoon, when the boat had a mechanical failure. "Shortly after the three fishermen had raised the alarm, cellphone contact and any means of communications with the three fishermen was lost," said Darren Zimmerman, NSRI Simon's Town station commander. Various NSRI teams, emergency personnel from the SA Police Service and a SA Air Force helicopter - responded after an eyewitness reported a boat "appearing to be adrift between Onrus and Hermanus". When the team reached the boat that had run aground at Sandbaai, they found the three men and tended to them. "NSRI medics and EMS paramedics conducted extensive CPR (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation) efforts on one of the fisherman, but sadly after all efforts to resuscitate the man were exhausted, he was declared deceased by paramedics. "The two survivors were medically treated by paramedics on the scene for hypothermia and have been transported to hospital by ambulance in serious, but stable, conditions. They are expected to make full recoveries," Zimmerman said. Police have opened an inquest docket. Meanwhile, two other men who had set out on a boat to try and find the three fishermen have also gone missing. Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) were continuing to coordinate a search and rescue operation for the two local men, said Zimmerman.
