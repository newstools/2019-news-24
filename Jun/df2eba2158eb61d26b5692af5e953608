Eight dedicated youngsters completed a 13-day walk from Durban to Cape Town on Friday, all to raise awareness and funds for pupils with intellectual disabilities. The walkers are members of the NPO Enabling Disability Education Nationally (EDEN) and walked a total of 1 643km. The co-founder of the organisation, Samuel Modise, said the campaign was all about inclusive, equitable and quality education. "It is about creating an equal society," he told News24 in Muizenberg on Friday. "I'm very passionate about seeing everyone get an equal opportunity." The group hopes to raise R600 000 to enroll 100 pupils with disabilities, from its hometown Pretoria, in a skills development programme. Despite the R108 000 contributed by the National Lottery to the campaign, the group's crowdfunding has not raised much due to technical difficulties. However, the eight are adamant to get the funds needed. Last year, the group walked 600km from Pretoria to Durban and raised R170 000 for the Transoranje School for the Deaf and Fanang Diatla Centre for the Disabled.
