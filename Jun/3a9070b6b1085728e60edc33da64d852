Ivanah Campbell's dance moves have stolen the hearts of international celebrities like Chris Evans and Will Smith. The six-year-old dancer from Port Elizabeth has also made a name for herself locally with a Facebook following of almost 40 000. News24 caught up with her ballet teacher Portia Appolis. "What a bubbly and gorgeous child," Appolis said. "She's just one of those kids that you know is going to be a star." In one video, Ivanah is seen dancing to American singer Lizzo's "Juice". Lizzo shared the footage online, commenting: "Rare footage of me as a child." That video has been watched more than 42 000 times since it was posted on Facebook on Friday. Commenting on the viral videos, Appolis said: "At her age, wow, I can't believe it!" "She has the x-factorâ€¦ You give her something and she adds a little extra," she told News24. Attempts to reach out to the Campbell family for their comment on little Ivanah's new-found international fame has so far proved unsuccessful.
