A 25-year-old "gang affiliate" was arrested on Wednesday night for allegedly shooting and injuring a 10-year-old boy in Gelvandale in Port Elizabeth. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the man was affiliated to the Dustlise gang and was arrested at his home in Gelvandale on Wednesday around 22:45. The boy was injured after a stray bullet struck him on Saturday. During the incident on Saturday at 19:00, three men were walking on the corner of Springbok and Tobias streets in Gelvandale, Naidu said. Three other men were then seen walking towards them. "Two males (including the accused) then pulled out firearms and started shooting at the three males, who managed to escape unharmed," Naidu said. "However, a stray bullet hit [the] 10-year-boy who was sitting on the pavement. He was struck in his upper arm and was taken to hospital for treatment. The three suspects then fled the scene," said Naidu. Police are investigating whether the three men who were shot at belonged to a gang. The man who was arrested is expected to appear in court on Friday on four counts of attempted murder. Police have launched a manhunt for the other two suspects.
