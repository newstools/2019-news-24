A 61-year-old man, who is in custody for allegedly killing a man after a fishing-related argument, appeared in the Witbank Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. André Fouche, who was arrested on Sunday at Seekoeiwater plot in Witbank, has been charged with murder and intends to apply for bail. According to police spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe, four teenaged children went fishing at the plot after they reportedly received the owner's permission to fish on the premises. Later that day, unknown tenants called the parents of the teenagers, Bhembe said. "The parents were informed that their children started a fire on the plot and also that they were fishing illegally, hence a R400 fine was payable for their kids to be released as they had been 'detained'. The parents arrived at the plot where an argument later ensued, between them and the tenants. "Fouche, who is the grandfather of two of the boys, claimed that the tenant (deceased) threw a stone at him and he retaliated by firing a shot at him with his hunting rifle. He was subsequently arrested on, 23 June 2019, hence his appearance today (Tuesday)," Bhembe said. The victim was transported to Witbank Hospital where he later died. Fouche is expected to appear in court again on July 1.  KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.  - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
