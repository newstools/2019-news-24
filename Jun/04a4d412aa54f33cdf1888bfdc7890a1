The woman accused of stealing a newborn baby at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto last week Thursday, appeared in the Protea Magistrate's Court in Soweto on Monday. Kereleng Ramoisa appeared in court on a charge of kidnapping. She is expected back in court on Wednesday, for a formal bail application, the NPA's Gauteng spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said. It is alleged that last Thursday, 24-year-old Ramoisa stole the baby a day after Bikokuhle Hlatshwayo had given birth to the child. She entered the hospital during visiting hours under the pretence that she was a relative of the newborn. Ramoisa then visited the maternity ward and started playing with the baby, before telling the nurses that she wanted to take the baby outside to show family members News24 reported. She however, did not return after leaving the hospital with the baby, wrapped in a blanket. The baby was found within 24 hours in Diepkloof, Soweto, following a tip-off after the health department handed over CCTV footage of the culprit. According to TimesLive  Hlatshwayo claimed that her newborn baby girl was sold for R2 500. But, police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini could not confirm her allegation. She claimed that police had told her that her child was sold for R2 500.
