We have come from a drought. A near disaster, yet still I hear people complaining about the cold and wet weather. Please don’t. The rain is a much-needed relief and a gift from God who has ended our suffering. Rain is good for our dying plants and trees, it means we can start taking longer showers and can use water more freely. I know that we are still restricted but we have more than we did a year ago. Be happy that there is rain so that you can take a shower and do everything else you need to do. The thought of standing in lines to fetch water while the military watches, does not sound like much fun. We have come from a drought.
