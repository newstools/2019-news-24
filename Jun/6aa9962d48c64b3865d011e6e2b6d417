A man was robbed of R25 000 by armed men outside his workplace in Boksburg on Friday afternoon. CCTV footage shows the suspects pulling up behind the victim after he arrived at work. According to the police, the 40-year-old victim was followed to his workplace in Anderbolt after cashing a cheque at a bank. He was unaware he was being followed. "While he waited for the gate to be opened, he was cornered by two suspects who allegedly pointed a firearm at him. The suspects broke the car's window and demanded the money," said Boksburg North police spokesperson Constable Justice Ramaube. Ramaube added that the suspects searched the victim's vehicle, took the money, and fled in a silver Volkswagen Polo - which can be seen in the video. A case of armed robbery has been opened. No arrests have been made. Ramaube told News24 that the case was classified as a "bank following" case, as victims are often followed after withdrawing large sums of money from their banks.
