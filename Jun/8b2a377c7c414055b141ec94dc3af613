Nick Evans, owner of KwaZulu-Natal Amphibian and Reptile Conservation, has urged the public not to panic as more snakes make an appearance in the region. Most recently, Evans was called out to Verulam, north of Durban after a family spotted a black mamba outside their home, trying to get through the sliding door. In a video recorded by the family before his arrival, the snake is seen trying to make its way into the house. Speaking to News24 on Thursday, Evans explained that it was simply trying to escape from the people that had surrounded it. "Black mambas are not aggressive. They are terrified of people," he said. Upon his arrival, he tried to capture it. The snake struck him, but did not bite. He explained that it was simply defending itself and said he was not injured in the process. "We're seeing more snakes because it's mating season, but black mambas are usually active throughout the year," he told News24. Evans said the snake looked healthy and was measured at 2.5 metres.
