Two suspected hijackers found themselves between a rock and a hard place in central Cape Town after the vehicle they were travelling lodged between a lamp post and concrete bollard. Patrolling metro police became suspicious when they spotted the white VW Polo sedan driving "extremely slow" down Orange Street in Gardens on Thursday night, said spokeperson Sergeant Ruth Solomons. "The officers followed the vehicle to see what the occupants' intention was, but the driver spotted them and sped off," she said. "During a chase along Mill Street, the driver lost control of the vehicle, left the roadway and got lodged between a lamp post and a concrete bollard."
