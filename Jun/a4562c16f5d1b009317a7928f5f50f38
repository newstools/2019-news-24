The 33-year-old former Bryanston High School sports coach accused of sexual harassment made another brief appearance in the Alexandra Magistrate's Court on Tuesday.

The former sports coach, who cannot be named until he pleads, was dismissed from the high school on March 1, after a disciplinary panel of three presiding officers found him guilty of all counts of sexual harassment and financial mismanagement.
