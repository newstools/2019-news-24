A seven-year-old
Australian boy who was in a coma after spending six hours in a freezing ocean,
has made a miraculous recovery. Julian Hohnen,
his father Maike (38) and a family friend were tossed into the ocean after
their boat capsized off Caloundra on Australia’s Sunshine Coast, the Mirror
UK reports. The trio were
hauled out of the water on Sunday morning after a search-and-rescue effort was
launched. Following the
rescue mission, Julian was put in an induced coma but miraculously opened his
eyes on Monday, Yahoo
News reports. Doctors had
initially thought the boy wouldn’t make it as he was suffering from hypothermia
and his condition had been classified as critical. “I would like to say thank you to everyone for their
love, support and prayers for my son Julian Hohnen. He is recovering well,” Julian’s
mother, Susan, wrote in a Facebook
post with a photo of him in hospital on Monday. “Our son has improved significantly today and is now
in a stable condition and talking to us. This is a testament to his fighting
spirit.” The boy’s father and their family friend, also
suffered hypothermia but have since been released from hospital. Susan and Maike went on to thank the emergency
services and children’s hospital where Julian was being treated. “We would like
to thank everyone who has helped and cared for our son, including the amazing
emergency services, the Sunshine Coast University Hospital and the Queensland
Children’s Hospital. “He still
requires further assessment, but his improvement today has given us hope.” Sources: Mirror UK, Yahoo News, Facebook
