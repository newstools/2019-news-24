For decades, there were tales from fishermen and tourists, even lots 
of photos, of a mysterious killer whale that just didn’t look like all 
the others, but scientists had never seen one. Now they have. An
 international team of researchers says they found a couple dozen of 
these distinctly different orcas roaming in the oceans off southern 
Chile in January. Scientists are waiting for DNA tests from a tissue 
sample but think it may be a distinct species. The National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration felt confident enough to trumpet 
the discovery of the long rumoured killer whale on Thursday. Some outside
 experts were more cautious, acknowledging the whales are different, but
 saying they’d wait for the test results to answer the species question.
