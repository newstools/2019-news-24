AFTER being held in protective custody since last month, the teenager who was arrested for allegedly stabbing another pupil outside the Heather Secondary School premises was released on Friday. The teenager was involved in an altercation with a fellow pupil in an incident that has gained traction on social media due to a video clip released on Facebook. Since the incident, the Maritzburg Fever can confirm that both pupils involved in the altercation have been expelled from the school. The boy, who has been charged with attempted murder of the other youth involved, was granted an order of release from the police custody where he was being held by magistrate NicoÂ­ Kinnears and has now been placed in the care of a guardian. During the incident, the 16-year-old allegedly stabbed his fellow pupil seven times. The accused was also injured during the scuffle, appearing at court with his left arm in a cast. The youth has been ordered to attend court on April 4.
