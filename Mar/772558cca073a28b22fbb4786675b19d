According to the Daily Mail,the unidentified woman allegedly boarded the Saudi Arabian Airlines flight without a "worry in the world", only realising she'd left her newborn baby in the departure lounge after the aircraft had already left the terminal. She told the cabin crew she'd forgotten her baby back at the terminal, forcing the pilot to turn flight SV832 from Saudi Arabia's capital city to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia back. Metro reports that audio has been released, depicting the moment the pilot requested permission to return. The pilot says: "May God be with us. Can we come back?" After which a conversation ensues between the air traffic controller and the pilot about protocol, as they'd never experienced anything like it before. "This flight is requesting to come back . . . a passenger forgot her baby in the waiting area, the poor thing," the controller says. They then ask for confirmation of the reason the flight wants to head back to the airport, to which the pilot responds: "We told you, a passenger left her baby in the terminal and refuses to continue the flight." "Okay, head back to the gate. This is totally a new one for us," the air traffic controller says. The bizarre delay reportedly took place over the weekend. Flight-tracking data showed a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight from Jeddah to Kuala Lumpur departed almost an hour late on Saturday, but it was unclear if it was the same one, reports Daily Mail.
