DA leader Mmusi Maimane has responded to a viral clip of him muddling his numbers while campaigning in a unique way – he participated in a social media challenge while giving factual information at the same time. Maimane first posted the video on his Twitter account, writing: "It's actually 4 out 10 South Africans who cannot find a job. Let's bring a job in every home." This, after some people on social media suggested that Maimane try the trending #WooliesWaterChallenge to correct his blunder after mistakenly saying that "44 out of 10" South Africans don't have jobs.
