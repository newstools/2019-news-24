WITH World Water Day and South Africa’s National Water Week celebrated in March, the Woolworths’ Education programme has been rolling out Water Conservation interactive learner lessons to Grade 5s across the country. On March 4, it was Malabar Primary School’s Grade 5 learners’ turn as they were taught the importance of water for all life, the scarcity of fresh water in South Africa and threats to our fresh water, such as pollution. Learners were also challenged to identify the ways in which they can help save water at home, at school and in their communities. After the lessons, the Woolworths Educational Programme educator resource and related worksheets are provided to the teachers, so that they can continue to reinforce the importance of water and water conservation learning in their classrooms. All resource material and lesson content is curriculum-aligned and endorsed by the Western Cape Education Department. Over the past 13 years, the Woolworths Educational Programme has presented 68 005 water lessons across the country reaching more than 2.5 million learners and 18 000 teachers in 6 000 Primary schools.
