The vehicle was carrying three other teenage passengers, aged between 17 and 19. "[T]he vehicle [allegedly] failed to stop at a stop sign in Alldays CBD, swerved out of the road and bumped over the stones and crashed into a wall of the mall," SAPS spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said in a statement on Sunday. He said the male driver, who "disappeared" from the scene and then "resurfaced", had a valid driver’s license. "The occupants sustained slight injuries and were rushed to the clinic to receive medical treatment," Ngoepe said.
