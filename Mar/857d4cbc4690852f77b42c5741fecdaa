"The  suspect grabbed the warden's cellphone from her pocket as she was walking in full uniform. She immediately gave chase and arrested him. As the traffic warden walked the suspect to a nearby mobile police trailer, she spotted a woman cutting another woman's handbag straps with a razor blade and stealing her purse, Minnaar said.
