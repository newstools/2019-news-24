South Africa must ensure that its institutions are protected and remain committed to its Constitution if it is to overcome the last decade and become competitive in the global economy. So says Francis Fukuyama, the world-renowned political scientist from Stanford University in the United States. He told News24 in an interview in Johannesburg that there are a number of things South Africa must do to emerge from the stagnation of the recent past – but that he is also not surprised by what has gone wrong in the country since 1994. Fukuyama rose to prominence in 1989 after the publication of an essay titled "The end of history", in which he argued that the fall of communism means that there are no impediments to the spread of liberal democracy in the world. The New Yorker said the essay "turned the world of foreign policy on his head". He has since published a number of books and academic works on governance, political systems and political change. His latest book is titled Identity: Contemporary identity politics and the struggle for recognition, in which he argues that the global urge for recognition drives the global dissatisfaction with the ruling world order.
