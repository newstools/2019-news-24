Two men convicted on charges related to a cash-in-transit in Parow, Cape Town, were sentencedÂ to four years in prison on Wednesday. Senzo Ponoyi, 28, and Nkosiphendule Khanyana, 35, attacked a G4S security guard at the Parow Shopping Centre in 2016. The guard had just collected money from the mall when he was held at gunpoint. The duo went off with the money box. "During their getaway, they dropped the cash box after it exploded. The local police were alerted and managed to arrest the two in possession of a toy gun not far from the crime scene," said Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase. Nkwalase said the docket was transferred to the Hawks' serious organised investigation unit which successfully opposed two bail attempts. Ponoyi and Khanyana were found guilty for robbery with aggravating circumstances on November 27, 2018. They were both sentenced to eight years' imprisonment and will effectively serve four years in jail.
