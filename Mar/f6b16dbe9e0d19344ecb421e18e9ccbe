A group of about 10 robbers attempted to steal gold that was being transported in a Toyota Land Cruiser in Boksburg, Johannesburg, police said on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele said the two occupants of the Toyota were injured after their car was riddled with bullets and have been taken to hospital for medical care. "They were transporting gold along the R21 in Jet Park in Boksburg when they were attacked by the group," said Makhubele. Police spokesperson Vish Naidoo said the two injured were guards. "Unfortunately, two guards were shot and seriously wounded during the attempt." The R21 has since been closed. Ekurhuleni police have launched a manhunt for the suspects, some of whom fled the scene in a VW Golf before police arrived. "The suspects fled in two sedans without being able to take anything," Naidoo said. Makhubele said nothing seemed to have been taken from the vehicle being driven by the guards and appealed to anyone with information to come forward. "We urge any member of the public who might have information which could lead to the arrests of these suspects to contact their nearest police station," Makhubele added.
