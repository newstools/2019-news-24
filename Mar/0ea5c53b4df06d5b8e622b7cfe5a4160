Cape Town traffic officers this week arrested three minibus-taxi drivers who were on the top 100 list for outstanding warrants. Between them, they had 222 warrants totalling just under R400 000, according to the City. One of the drivers, 36, who had 56 warrants valued at R103 500, was arrested on Jakes Gerwel Drive. Another driver, 35, who had 133 warrants amounting to R188 650, was arrested at the Ndabeni pound. "His vehicle was impounded two weeks ago in Brackenfell and he actually had the temerity to show up at the pound," said safety and security mayoral committee member JP Smith. The third driver was arrested at a roadblock in Mitchells Plain. He had 33 warrants valued at R100 600. "I want to commend the officers who made these very significant arrests and I hope that the courts throw the book at these drivers," said Smith. "It is the only way that weâ€™ll get a handle on the reckless behaviour on our roads and disregard for the law." In response to numerous complaints about the taxi industry from the public, the City was ramping up its operations to also focus on operating licences, overloading and driving offences. "To commuters and other road users, we apologise in advance for any inconvenience these operations may cause, but we have no other alternative," said Smith. "The warning also extends to private motorists, because contrary to popular belief, public transport operators are not the only guilty parties on our roads."
