A foetus in a plastic container washed up in a storm drain in Durban following heavy rains, paramedic services said on Friday. Rescue Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said he was called out to the corner of Mount Batten Drive and Winchester Road in Reservoir Hills. "Paramedics were called by police and the local community to a baby that had been dumped and thereafter washed up by the storm water drain following heavy recent rains." He said the foetus, which was not full term, was assessed and declared dead on the scene. "Police are in attendance and will be investigating further," Jamieson added. About a month ago, a "miracle baby" was saved from a storm water drainpipe after emergency services conducted a three-hour mammoth rescue in Newlands East. Passers-by heard the child's cries at around 07:30 on February 11 and alerted authorities.

The child could be heard during the entire rescue. In the same week, a premature baby made a miraculous escape when he was discovered wrapped up in a pillow after his mother allegedly dumped him in a medical waste bin at King Edward VIII Hospital in Durban.
