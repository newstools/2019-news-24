WHEN Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (NMBM) needed to upgrade its existing firefighting fleet, they procured some tough machines right on their door step. Locally built at Isuzu Motors South Africa’s Port Elizabeth truck plant, the Isuzu FXZ 26-360 6x4, fitted with an Allison 4430PR automatic transmission, was modified for its purpose nearby at Isuzu’s subsidiary, Kanu Commercial Body Builders, in Marksman Township. Kanu general sales manager, Michael Corney, explained that the conversion included the truck being fitted with a 13 500-litre water tank, high pressure pump equipment, two hose reels, firefighting equipment and a host of other items. “These trucks are able to extinguish fires in rough terrain and will help fire fighters to access challenging areas,” said Corney. He said while it was the first firefighting water truck of its kind supplied to the NMBM by Isuzu and Kanu Commercial Body Builders, it formed part of an ongoing supplier partnership with the local government of the city, where Isuzu Motors South Africa’s bakkie and truck production plant is situated. “We will continue to work with various departments within the municipality to advise on product solutions that are best suited for their needs,” added Corney. NMBM spokesperson, Kupido Baron, said although the legislatively prescribed process was followed with this award, it remained pleasing to do business with a company based locally, as it was in line with the municipality’s local economic development initiatives. “The success of Isuzu Motors South Africa with this acquisition and the fact that these specialised vehicles are able to negotiate much tougher terrain than normal fire engines, will assist our brave firefighters in their continuous quest to keep our citizens and property safe,” said Baron.
