The 13-year-old boy who was arrested in connection with the murder of a Mondeor High School pupil, appeared in the juvenile section of the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court's on Thursday. The case was postponed to Friday to give him an opportunity to be assessed by a probation officer. "The probation officer will then compile a report that will be presented to the court so that a process of conducting a preliminary inquiry can be kickstarted," said National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane. He was in a place of safety, Mjonondwane added. The boy was arrested on Wednesday evening. Gauteng police made a breakthrough on Thursday morning when two more teens, believed to be from a nearby school, were nabbed. Earlier on Thursday morning, Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said the arrests had taken place in Soweto and Naturena respectively and that the suspects were both aged 15.
