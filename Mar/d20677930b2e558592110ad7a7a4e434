With World Water Day and South Africaâ€™s National Water Week celebrated later this month, the Woolworths Educational Programme has been rolling out interactive Water Conservation learner lessons to Grade 5 learners across the country. On Tuesday 5 March the initiative was taken to Kewton Primary School, where the Grade 5 learners were taught the importance of water for all life, the scarcity of fresh water in South Africa and threats to fresh water, such as pollution. Learners were also challenged to identify ways that can help save water at home, at school, and in their communities. After the lessons, the Woolworths Educational Programme educator resource and related worksheets are provided to the teachers so that they can continue to reinforce the importance of water and water conservation learning in their classrooms. All resource material and lesson content is curriculum-aligned and endorsed by the Western Cape Education Department. Over the past 13 years, the Woolworths Educational Programme has presented 68 005 water lessons across the country reaching more than 2.5 million learners and 18 000 teachers in 6 000 primary schools.
