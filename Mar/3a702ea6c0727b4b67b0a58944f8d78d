The mere
mention of Eskom these days is enough to make ordinary South Africans’ blood
boil. On Sunday, 17
March, the utilities company instituted stage 4 loadshedding due to a lack of
capacity. And it’s unlikely that the power will be permanently switched back on
any time soon. We’ve dug
through our archives to find you our top loadshedding survival tips: SURGE PROTECTION Electrical
appliances weren’t designed to deal with power outages. That means
instabilities in the power supply can damage your flatscreen TV in the long run.
If you’re home when the power goes off, rather unplug appliances until after
the power’s come back on. Otherwise,
it’s a good idea to buy surge protection adapters. Costs range from about R130
to more than R300, depending on the brand and number of plug points. COOKING It’s a good
idea to invest in a small gas stove – unless you’re comfortable with eating
sandwiches for dinner every night. A small two-plate stove costs between R450
and R900. At the very least you’ll be able to boil water for that essential
first cup of coffee of the day. LIGHTING Candles,
lanterns and flashlights are all fine and well, but what if the power suddenly
trips and you can’t find anything in the dark? It might be a good idea to buy a
rechargeable lightbulb and replace a normal lightbulb in a central room in your
home with it, or screw it into your bedside lamp – that way, you’ll always know
where it is. These bulbs can cost anything from R80 to more than R300. As for
outside lights, there are lights for your garden that work with solar power and
can light your way if you happen to get home in the dark.
