The ANC in Sedibeng has laid charges of fraud and corruption against the Midvaal Municipality, which is run by the Democratic Alliance (DA). "The ANC in Sedibeng has noted with serious concern the crop of corruption that is happening in the Midvaal Local Municipality under the leadership of the DA... The people of Midvaal continue to suffer injustices with the lack of accountability by the management of the municipality," ANC regional task team coordinator Sphiwe Mgcina said in a statement on Tuesday. This comes after the municipality was embroiled in an alleged "cash for jobs" scandal which implicated mayoral committee member for corporate services Amelia Tsukudu, four directors, and deputy municipal manager Thom Peeters. Peeters was put on special leave following allegations that he had appointed workers before the interview process, News24 reported.

"The DA is running out of time to save its dominant spot in Midvaal and it is now resorting to corruption, among other things, to buy support, and in some areas rule with intimidation over the people that have put them in power. "The DA cannot continue in the manner which it has been doing," Mgcina concluded.
