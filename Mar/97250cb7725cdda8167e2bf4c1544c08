Rand Water says its bulk water supply remains stable despite ongoing load shedding. Rand Water Media relations manager Justice Mohale said the utility was "closely monitoring" the possible impact as a consequence of load shedding. He said that some municipalities within the utility's area of supply had also experienced electricity infrastructure failures, but insisted they had posed no risk to the water supply network. "In the event that load shedding levels are elevated or prolonged, Rand Water will timeously communicate the impact thereof," said Mohale. Rand Water noted that some municipalities had already advised consumers to reduce their consumption of water, and urged the same. "Currently our bulk water network supplying our customers remains stable and we are managing demand as normal," Mohale said.
