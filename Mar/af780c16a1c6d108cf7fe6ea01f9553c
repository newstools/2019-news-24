The ANC has distanced itself from a jobs scam being circulated on social media platforms. In a statement released on Thursday, the party says it "is deeply disturbed by a scam circulating on social media platforms purported to emanate from the organisation". It denies the banner's claim that the party is looking to hire people on a full-time basis to do social media work. "The fake banner deceitfully claims that the organisation is looking to hire people full-time for social media presence at a stipend. This is a fabrication as the organisation has a full complement of human resources in its communications office that is sufficient to discharge any capabilities currently required by the organisation," read the statement.
