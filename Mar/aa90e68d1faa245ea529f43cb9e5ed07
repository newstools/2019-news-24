Maphumulo was arrested on Tuesday afternoon after a video of him launching a physical attack on his partner, Gqom artist Bongekile "Babes Wodumo" Simelane went viral in the early hours of Monday morning. He has been instructed by the court to have no contact with Simelane. The State has further revealed that the gqom artist has been moved to a different location since the incident. Maphumulo appeared in court on Tuesday with an apparent injury to his right foot. He was told not to communicate with Simelane.  Maphumulo told reporters on the steps of the court, shortly after his appearance, that the attack on Monday was sparked by Simelane, who had come home drunk and began attacking him while he was peacefully sleeping and sober. He told reporters that he had opened a case of assault against Simelane however national police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo could not verify these claims yet. "Maphumulo must give the media his case number first and then I can verify if he has opened a case or not," he told News24 on Tuesday.
