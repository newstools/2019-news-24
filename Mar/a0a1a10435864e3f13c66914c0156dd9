A R3 000 fine or six months behind bars is what the Atteridgeville Regional Court gave a Pretoria taxi driver who tried to bribe officers when he was caught driving an unroadworthy vehicle. The driver offered the officers R200, but ended up behind bars instead. The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) has welcomed the penalty imposed. Thabani Nqakula was arrested in January 2019. RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said that Nqakula was "stopped for driving an unroadworthy vehicle on a public road where he offered the officers money to avoid receiving a traffic fine". "He was arrested immediately and charged with bribery," added Zwane. Zwane said at least 50 other motorists, in Gauteng alone, have been arrested since the beginning of 2019 and the prosecution of the cases were at various stages. RTMC CEO, advocate Makhosini Msibi, welcomed Nqakula'a sentence. "This conviction will send to a message to motorists that they can no longer break traffic laws with impunity. Our traffic officers are no longer prepared to have their good name tarnished by motorists who are not prepared to obey the rules of the road," said Msibi. Msibi also called on all traffic officers to show zero tolerance to anyone who attempted to corrupt them. He said South Africa needs traffic officers who are prepared to enforce the law without fear or favour to reduce the high number of road fatalities.
