President Cyril Ramaphosa moved and shook his body to the ANC's new election track Let's grow South Africa together, at a rally ahead of the general elections. Ramaphosa was at the rally in KwaZulu-Natal when a male dancer clad in training gear took to the stage. The president joined him, trying his darnedest to prove that his age hasn't caught up with him just yet. Many people took to social media to have their say about the president's antics. Responses varied from praise and laughter to shock and criticism. A PRESIDENT!! #growsouthafrica #ThumaMina pic.twitter.com/H1LzdBnydD His predecessors often danced when the opportunity arose.
