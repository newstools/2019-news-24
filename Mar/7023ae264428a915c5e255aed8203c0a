The National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) has received video footage of a group of individuals brutally beating and butchering a live kudu on the street. It is not clear where the incident took place. The NSPCA was contacted by a member of the public after the video started circulating. "We received the video yesterday afternoon," NSPCA inspector Irinka Schröder said. "We do not know where the incident took place, and there is no way to tell" in which state the kudu is in, Schröder added. She said at this stage, the NSPCA required more information to conduct a proper investigation, but an initial probe is currently under way. "This is completely unacceptable and disturbing. "It is incredibly cruel and we need to find out who the perpetrators are," Schröder said. The video shows a young man beating the kudu with what looks like a metal rod, while dogs bite at its legs. The kudu is already bleeding at this point before a group begins cutting at its throat, mid area and chopping its hind leg off. Anyone with information is urged to contact the wildlife protection unit directly on 011 907 3590/1/2/3 or wild8@nspca.co.za Warning: Graphic content  Images: Screengrabs via NSPCA Facebook page    KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
