Motorists are urged to use alternative routes via the R44 Kleinmond coastal route to get back onto the N2 toward Gordon's Bay." Western Cape police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed that law enforcement agencies were on the scene. "The road is closed due to a service delivery protest which started yesterday.
