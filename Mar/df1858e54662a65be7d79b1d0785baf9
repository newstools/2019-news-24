Former Bosasa chief operations officer (COO) Angelo Agrizzi, who made headlines with his explosive testimony at the state capture commission of inquiry, briefly appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria for corruption on Wednesday. Alongside him in the dock were former Bosasa executive Andries van Tonder, senior Bosasa official Frans Voster, current Bosasa employee Carlos Bonifacio, former correctional services CFO Patrick Gillingham and former correctional services commissioner Linda Mti. They have been charged with corruption, money laundering and fraud to the tune of R1.6bn.

The case was postponed to July 5 so that liquidation proceedings of African Global Operations (AGO), which was formerly known as Bosasa, could be concluded. This comes after Acting Judge Joolam Ameer in the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg admitted he may have erred by removing the liquidators and granted them leave to appeal his earlier ruling to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein. As a result, the liquidators will now approach the SCA on an urgent basis to permanently regain control of what is left of AGO, News 24 earlier reported.
