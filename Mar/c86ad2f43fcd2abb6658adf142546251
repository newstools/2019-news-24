The Democratic Alliance has released its list of candidates for the National Assembly and provincial legislatures ahead of the 2019 general elections. As expected, party leader Mmusi Maimane tops the list, while stand-out figures John Steenhuisen, Natasha Mazzone, James Selfe, Mike Waters and Glynnis Breytenbach also feature among the top names. Gwen Ngwenya, who resigned as the party's head of policy in January, is also named on the list.
