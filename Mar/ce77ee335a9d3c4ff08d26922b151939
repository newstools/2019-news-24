Senior citizens and people living with disability in ward 89, Site B, converged at Matthew Goniwe Memorial High School in an engagement meeting with their ward councillor Monde Nqulwana to express their unhappiness about their houses. The citizens described the meeting as a platform to engage with Nqulwana and come up with solutions. One of the elders Thandeka Fokazi (76) from R section said as elders they don’t get opportunities to attend the public meetings because most of them happen in the evenings. “Today we were mainly focusing on housing. Most of us here have similar challenges as our houses were built in the late 90’s and others early 2000s. “They are very small and poorly constructed with no rooms. They were not plastered and when it’s raining the walls get wet. “There was no ceiling and we had to fix it ourselves,” said Fokazi. Nqulwana confirmed the meeting and vowed to address their concerns and have some of their houses repaired.. He said about 83 houses were approved by the human settlements minister Bonginkosi Madikizela. The construction is expected to start in June and continue until March next year. “There are another 143 names that were forwarded to Madikizela’s office for approval. They (elders and disabled people) appreciated the intervention because the majority of them can’t afford to renovate their houses. They are pensioners and are surviving with an old age grant,” said Nqulwana. He stated that their houses are the first houses that were built just after the country gain democracy. “The houses are those ‘match-box’ houses. It will get plastered, get a ceiling and windows and door frames will be changed if necessary. And if the roof is also leaking we change it,” vowed Nqulwana.
