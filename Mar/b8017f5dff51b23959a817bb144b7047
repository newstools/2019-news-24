Three teenagers, aged between 13 and 15, are expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Friday in connection with the murder of a Mondeor High School pupil. Kulani Mathebula, 19, was on his way to school at around 07:00 on Wednesday when he was assaulted by three pupils, believed to be from a nearby school. They face a charge of murder. Shortly after the incident, police formed a team of detectives who followed up information obtained at the scene. It led them to arresting the 13-year-old on Wednesday evening, who appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court's juvenile section on Thursday.

"The probation officer will then compile a report that will be presented to the court so that a process of conducting a preliminary inquiry can be kickstarted," said National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane. The 15-year-olds were arrested in Soweto and Naturena in the early hours of Thursday.
