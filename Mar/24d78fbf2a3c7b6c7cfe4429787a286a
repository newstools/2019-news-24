"While they were passing the Ngome policing area, the prisoners held up the police officers and took their firearms. "The vehicle stopped and the prisoners fired shots. Five prisoners escaped with police firearms." Zwane said the prisoners were in custody for rape, robbery and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Following the incident, a manhunt was launched by various police units, including a K9 unit. "[On Tuesday] night, four prisoners were traced and rearrested. "One prisoner is still at large and the police are still looking for him," Zwane said. Two firearms that were taken from the police officers were recovered from the rearrested prisoners.
