Former president Jacob Zuma has questioned the culpable homicide prosecution of his son Duduzane, saying it may be part of an attempt, by some organisation, to get back at him. "It is difficult to say that is not the case (getting back at Zuma) because there was a process that was undertaken, which was a legal process and it was concluded. "Why now come back?" Zuma asked. Zuma added that there was no overwhelming evidence to suggest any negligence from his son on the night that he crashed into a taxi.

He was speaking to journalists on the doorstep of Courtroom 13 of the Randburg Magistrate's Court, on the second day of his son's trial on Wednesday.

The case has been postponed to Friday while the magistrate decides a defence discharge application in which his counsel argued that the state had no case.
