The graphic video of Babes sent shock waves around the nation with many angered locals asking for Mampintsha’s his arrest. Although Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa has condemned any form of abuse against women, local celebs such as rapper Cassper Nyovest believe that not enough is being done by the government to protect women. I really wanna see what the cops are gonna do now that there's hard evidence that the whole country is watching. My guess is NOTHING. I have lost all confidence in our police and our justice system. First off, fuck Mampintsha! I said it then & I’ll say it now. He needs to be arrested & I hope it happens today. For those that keep asking though, this doesn’t change a damn thing about how Masechaba handled that situation. That sh!t was wrong too. I'm so scared for Babes. Abusers like Mampintsa hate being exposed. They've managed to make everyone around them cover up for them including industry friends etc, so how dare she show the truth. I really hope she is safe https://t.co/aq85OrS4Cu  READ MORE: Babes' sister Nonduh on viral video: 'She is doing okay and is resting' A post shared by Bongekile Simelane (@babes_wodumo) on Dec 30, 2017 at 9:12am PST           24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
