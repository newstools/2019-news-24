Spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said that the blaze gutted a transformer, plunging the suburbs of Chatsworth, Pinetown and greater Queensburgh into darkness. The fire started around 14:45, he said, and authorities were on scene. "We are currently conducting an investigation to determine what caused the fire," he added. "eThekwini Municipality sincerely apologises for the inconvenience this will cause to residents. Our teams are at the scene and working unceasingly to restore power as soon possible." In a weird twist, a transformer caught alight at a 275 kilovolt substation in Klaarwater at the same time last year, on March 14.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
