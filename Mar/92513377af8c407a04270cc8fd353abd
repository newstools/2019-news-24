The schoolboy, 16, who described himself as an "untouchable" in the video showing the murder of Thoriso Themane will join six other minors in the Polokwane Children's Court on Friday, March 22. The schoolboy appeared briefly in the Polokwane Magistrate's Court on Wednesday on a separate charge of attempted murder. He appeared in camera because he is a minor. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson in Limpopo Mashudu Malabi confirmed that the teenager would face a murder charge relating to Themane's death when he appears in court on Friday. The attempted murder charge is related to an incident in which he allegedly attacked a fellow pupil in December last year. It was not pursued at the time. The charge was reinstated after outcry from the #justiceforthoriso movement and members of the public. He was arrested a week ago. In the video of the murder, the schoolboy boasted that he was "untouchable" because his father was a senior police officer. It later emerged that the father was a retired warrant officer in the South African Police Service. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
