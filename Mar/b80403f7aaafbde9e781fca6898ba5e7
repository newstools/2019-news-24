BASEBALL players and brothers, Dylan le Roux and Damian le Roux, have both been chosen for junior teams of South    Africa Baseball which will be seen in action during the SA tournament starting at Londt Park tomorrow. Five years ago, Dylan was chosen for the SA U/15  baseball side which participated in the 2015 Baseball   World Cup held in Mexico. He said he was looking forward to the tournament starting this Friday, as many of the guys that toured with him at national level will now play against him to qualify for the Olympics. Damian was chosen for the SA U/12 side. He said all youngsters must come and see for themselves how fast the game of baseball is. The Nelson Mandela Metro will be represented at U/10, U/12, U/15, U/18 and senior level. Games will be played from 22-26 March. “Come and watch the top baseball players currently  in the country competing at the National Baseball Championships in Port Elizabeth. “We have a good pool of talent available for selection. “I am excited to see these players display their baseball skills,” said Neil Addonis, South African Baseball coach.
