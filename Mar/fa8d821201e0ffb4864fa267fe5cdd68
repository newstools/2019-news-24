This comes after the complainant, who owns an engineering company, found that a woman who had been employed by the company since 2015, had defrauded him. "The complainant realised later last year that he was defrauded of large undisclosed cash. "The company conducted its own internal investigations and found that the suspect had transferred cash into her personal account over three years," Kagiso police Captain Solomon Sibiya said in a statement on Thursday. The complainant then laid a case of fraud against the woman at the Kagiso police station. "The information was followed, and the suspect was eventually arrested and detained at Kagiso SAPS," Sibiya added. The suspect, who cannot be named, will appear in the Kagiso Magistrate's Court soon.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
