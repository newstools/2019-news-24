THE South African Police Service (SAPS) in KwaZakhele, joined by Clover Krush, embarked on a safer schools campaign to make the youth aware of crime and child safety at schools. A total of 800 learners from Mzimhlophe Primary School were the first in the Motherwell cluster to take part in the safer schools campaign. The sponsor, Clover Krush, donated new school shoes to the learners. According to Colonel Glen Liebenberg, in order to also cater for young children and the elderly, the campaign will be including preschools, day care centres and old age homes in the city. “This campaign has been launched to make everyone aware of crime – young and old. However, we mostly go around schools and have sessions with the learners about crime, bullying and obeying the law. “Some of the learners are exposed to crime on a daily basis and we want to make them aware of what is right and wrong, in terms of crime,” Liebenberg said. The campaign supports safer schools and victim empowerment, as well as attending to the needs of the less fortunate and fragile communities. The Kwazakele police, comprising the sector managers and the Community Police Forum, as well as community police officers, joined hands with Clover Krush at the school where crime awareness guidelines for child safety were explained. After the first visit, the campaign was also conducted at Sakhuluntu Preschool, Masilakhe Day Care Centre, Ekuphumleni Old Age Home and Phakama Primary School. Liebenberg added, “During the next few days, more schools, preschools and old age homes will be visited, to make them aware of crime. We hope that this campaign will assist in curbing crime in the city.”
