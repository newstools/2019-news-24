Police in Gauteng seem to have foiled what could have been a robbery of goods from a high-tech store in Randburg when they intercepted six suspects on Saturday morning. The goods are said to be worth millions. "Members of the Provincial Tracing Teams and Tactical Response Team responded to information about a gang that had conspired to rob a shop dealing with high-tech computers and cell phones in Randburg. During an operation, a group of suspects entered the premises travelling in two vehicles. "Their vehicles were intercepted and six suspects were confronted," police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said in a statement on Sunday. Police discovered two firearms, a jammer and cable ties as suspects were being taken out the vehicle. A third firearm was found in the second vehicle. "It is believed that some of the accomplices who walked into the park might have escaped when police stopped the vehicles. "No shots were fired during the police operation," Dlamini added. The three unlicensed pistols have since been sent for ballistic tests to determine if they were used in any other crimes. Police are currently profiling and questioning the group of suspects who have been charged with conspiracy to rob and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. The group will be appearing at the Randburg Magistrates Court on Monday.
