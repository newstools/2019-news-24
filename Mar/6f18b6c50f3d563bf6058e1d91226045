Postma High School in Potchefstroom, North West, attends his farewell later
this year, he’ll be wearing the same cream suit his dad wore to his matric ball
three decades ago. Jaco Snyman (48), Johan’s dad, wore the suit to his
matric dance in 1988 at the Hoër Tegniese Skool Potchefstroom. Jaco’s mother – and Johan’s grandmother – Stientjie de
Wet (73), a seamstress, had made the suit. It’s been in her care for the past
31 years, says Jaco’s wife, Anne-Marie (48). “It’s so special to us that my son can wear his dad’s
suit his mother made him 31 years ago. It’s really something precious. It’s
also nice to give my mom-in-law a bit of recognition for her years of making
beautiful wedding gowns and matric farewell dresses,” Anne-Marie says. “And to top it all, my mom-in-law also offered to make
my son’s matric farewell date a dress. It’s still quite some time to go. We’ll
know more closer to the time.” Anne-Marie says her son feels honoured to be wearing
his dad’s “fashionable suit, which you won’t find in any shop” to the dance on
20 September. “The cummerbund and bow tie are the originals. The
only items that weren’t part of the original outfit are the shoes and shirt.” Jaco and Johan, his eldest son, have a close bond and
enjoy going on fishing trips together. Jaco is a car mechanic and Johan plans on studying
electrical and electronic engineering next year. Jaco and Anne-Marie also have a younger son, Marco
(16), who’s a pupil at Ferdinand Postma High too.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
