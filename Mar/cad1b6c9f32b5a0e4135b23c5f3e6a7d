The Right to Know campaign (R2K) has called on authorities to bring an immediate end to violent attacks on foreign nationals in KwaZulu-Natal. On Friday, the advocacy group also called on the government and leaders to "refrain from making utterances that can fuel anger and hate which, as we see, are resulting in widespread violence". "We call on political leaders to refrain from a narrative that seeks to propose foreign nationals as the problem in this country, which we view as an unfortunate attempt to divert attention from the real frustrations and genuine challenges faced by communities." They added: "We cannot allow a situation where foreign nationals are used as a proxy for political battles." Protests erupted this week and police had to intervene in various areas in Durban. It is alleged that a group of about 100 people attacked tuckshop owners and local shop owners on Sunday in Kernville, Sea Cow Lake, Inanda bridge and surrounding areas in the Greenwood Park area. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said shop owners opened fire, killing a 22-year-old man and wounding others, who were taken to hospital for medical attention. One of the victims later died in hospital.

The organisation also called on the government to put in place strategies to mitigate the simmering tension. "We demand that a thorough investigation of individuals who are implicated in the generation of and disbursement of hateful messages in the media and other platforms, especially political leaders; and that these leaders be taken to task."
