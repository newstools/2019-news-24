The Durban Regional Court has sentenced nine Kaizer Chiefs supporters for public violence committed at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. According to TimesLive, one of the men, Kwezilomo Madiba, was sentenced to three years in jail after he had been caught on camera assaulting a security guard. The other eight received wholly suspended sentences. On that day, unhappy Kaizer Chiefs fans invaded the pitch, assaulted a security guard and damaged broadcast equipment after Kaizer Chiefs lost to Free State Stars 2-0 in the Nedbank Cup semi-final on April 21, 2018. About 18 people were injured in the chaos, and damage to the stadium was estimated to amount to around R2.6m, News24 reported at the time. The entire incident was captured live on camera.
