WARNING: Please note that Hlaudi Motsoeneng speaks about Hlaudi Motsoeneng in the third person in this video.   Hlaudi Motsoeneng. Just saying those two words usually elicits laughter or sniggers, the rolling of eyes or astonished emojis, head shakes or disgust. And the name of the self-described "intellectual acamedic (sic)" is back in the headlines once again. In a video announcing the African Content Movement's manifesto launch set to take place on April 6 in KwaZulu-Natal, party president Motsoeneng extols his virtues and tells South Africans just what he will do for them if (and let's be honest, it's a big if) his party wins the May 8 national election. Standing under a tree (why?) the former SABC chief operations officer promises an "action manifesto" that will see him bringing change to the country within six months of ascending to the Union Buildings. Motsoeneng's video has drawn widespread reaction from many South Africans, with people sharing the video on WhatsApp groups and taking to social media to comment on his promises. The term "Hlaudi" was even trending on Twitter for several hours on Thursday morning. But most of the comments aren't too flattering, not that the ACM president is likely to care. Wait for it... Whatever Hlaudi smokes is really potent. I want to have this confidence when I grow up?????? pic.twitter.com/vpfoOqqnM4 Hlaudi is a dangerous clown that should be put in hospital ??????Thread of his funniest moments ???? pic.twitter.com/HSfjsODJBr I have so many questions about that Hlaudi video.1) Why is he under a tree?2) Why didn't anyone realise that the video is getting more and more incoherent as he continued to speak?3) Who decided that type of video would be a good idea?4) Why is Hlaudi over excited?TBC KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24Â on Twitter
