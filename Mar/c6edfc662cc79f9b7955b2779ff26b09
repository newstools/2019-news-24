'Twas a weekend of load shedding, no lights in the house. No vacuums were stirring (to the relief of dear spouse). The kids fixed their eyes on the TV with care, in hopes that ol’ Eskom would soon put stuff there... South Africans woke up to the misery of Stage 2 load shedding on Saturday morning. But like any good reality show, there was a blindside to the predictable plot when the power utility turned up the drama dial and jumped to Stage 4 within a matter of hours. This move prompted many an eye roll, especially for the future of the economy and government: Saturday 12noon, SA implements DD Mabuza Economy Growth Stage 4. #ANC making SA 'grow'. Stage 4 #eskomloadshedding ... not far to go until we hit #Venezuela ... but wait, that's a good thing according to some of our politicos... #loadshedding pic.twitter.com/mHXgRgiehH #Loadshedding Stage 4 means 4 % economic growth #GrowSouthAfrica #eskom pic.twitter.com/MVaD7ae3q7 Stage 3 loadshedding, because its raining in Mozambique. Ok then. This has the potential to absolutely destroy @MYANC at polls. #Loadsheding Sports fans felt like tackling someone: No power, stream sport, use a kak load of data and still pay electricity bill @SuperSportTV @SuperSportBlitz @DStv @MultiChoice #SSCricket #loadshedding So I won't be able to witness my beloved @orlandopirates march into the last 8 according to Eskom... ya neh diabowa str8 #Loadsheding #CAFCL And some felt like they had been played: Just wrote a 7 hour paper and I came out to stage 4 load shedding..huh Eskom you playing games here When you have your evening pizza accompanied by glass red vino at 3pm 'cause Eskom at Stage 4 so likely "cut off" around supper time. #Ineptitude #Corruption #SouthAfrica Talking of games, it did not escape notice that winter was a few months away: It’s mid summer and we hear stage 4 loadshedding is upon us... can’t imagine what we will get mid winter then? ????‍?? pic.twitter.com/yrlgEnQcNj The terrifying effects of all this power outage is that we are not even in winter #Loadsheding The absence of electronic stimulation had people reflecting: #Loadshedding will have you re-evaluating your whole life. Your past, your present, your future... everything pic.twitter.com/fYrRX2TXF4 #Eskom needs employ influencers to make us feel like #LoadShedding is cool But as always, we could rely on at least two people to show us the bright side: Yes, #LoadShedding sucks ... but I have two children playing Uno and two children playing Top Trumps, while I read a novel. The sound of laughter (and friendly arguing) is ringing through my home. I’m enjoying this ... for the moment. #Loadsheding doesn't bother me, either way being bored is an option, go out and do something. Read a book, hangout with your friends and stay off the phone. Live Life man.Just Saying. They is more to life than just watching TV and being on your phone.
