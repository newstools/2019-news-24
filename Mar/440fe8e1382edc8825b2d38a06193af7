The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has confirmed one of its members, Harry Gwala mayor Mluleki Ndobe, and a second person have been taken in by police in connection with the murder of Sindiso Magaqa. The former ANC Youth League secretary general died in hospital in September 2017, around two months after he was shot in Mzimkhulu, south of Durban. One man, Sibusiso Ncengwa, was arrested almost a year to the day of Magaqa's death in the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital.
