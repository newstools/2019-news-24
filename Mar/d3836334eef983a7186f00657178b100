The rise of populist nationalism globally has seen liberal democracy come under increasing pressure. Francis Fukuyama, the acclaimed political scientist from Stanford University in the United States, tells News24 how the rise of populism – also in South Africa – might impact society in the future. Fukuyama rose to prominence in 1989 after the publication of an essay titled "The end of history" in which he argued that the fall of communism means that there are no impediments to the spread of liberal democracy in the world. The New Yorker said the essay "turned the world of foreign policy on his head". He has since published a number of books and academic works on governance, political systems and political change. His latest book is titled Identity: Contemporary identity politics and the struggle for recognition in which he argues that the global urge for recognition drives the global dissatisfaction with the ruling world order. Fukuyama is currently in the country as a guest of the Centre for Development and Enterprise (CDE). KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
