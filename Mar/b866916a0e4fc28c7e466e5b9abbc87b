MMC for Environment and Infrastructure Services Nico de Jager announced on Sunday that the employee had been found guilty of misconduct and collusion with contractors leading to the unlawful payments made. "The employee was suspended when City Power initiated the investigation into his involvement. He was found guilty of gross negligence in his duties, resulting in financial loss to the City of Johannesburg," de Jager said in a statement. According to de Jager, this is the second employee that has been dismissed this month, after another employee was also found guilty of collusion with the same contractor, Setheo Engineering. "Setheo Engineering received payments exceeding R88 million for work that was never completed in the building of the Eldorado Park sub-station and refurbishment of the Hopefield sub-station. "They had secured the contract through a fraudulent bank guarantee which led the City to believe that they had the balance sheet to handle the project." De Jager added that two of the Setheo Engineering directors were arrested in 2017, but that the National Prosecuting Authority has since withdrawn the case from the roll. "Corruption is public enemy number one, and we cannot allow corruption to steal from our residents. When acts of corruption take place, it undermines the hard work of honest officials in the City and honest taxpaying residents who expect services delivered in their communities," de Jager said.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
