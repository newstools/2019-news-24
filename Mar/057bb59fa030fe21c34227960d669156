A woman who allegedly drove her car into a Standard Bank branch on the East Rand on Friday is in police custody after being charged with malicious damage to property, police have confirmed. The motorist, who is in her 40s, was arrested at the scene, SAPS spokesperson Captain Pheelo Mothapo said. "She had an argument with a teller [on Friday] about the withdrawal of money. The bank could not help her so she got very angry," he told News24. "She exited, climbed into her vehicle and drove into the bank. Police were alerted and she was arrested on the spot." Mothapo said the argument ostensibly stemmed from the woman's refusal to follow the bank queue. She is expected to appear in the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday. On Friday, Standard Bank confirmed none of their staff members or clients were injured in the incident. Standard Bank's Ross Linstrom said the client was "served in a professional manner and in line with client-service procedures". The query, according to Linstrom, was "of a complex nature".
