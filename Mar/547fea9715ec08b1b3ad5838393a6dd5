Police union boss Mpho Kwinika faces charges of drinking in public, assault and crimen injuria after allegedly resisting arrest in Sunnyside, Pretoria on Friday evening, according to national police. "Initially, he was arrested for drinking in public," national police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said on Tuesday. "The assault and the crimen injuria happened as a result of him resisting, but more will be revealed when he appears in court on Wednesday." Meanwhile, Kwinika's union - the South African Policing Union (Sapu) - said they were disappointed at the conduct of the police when carrying out the arrest and the alleged assault of Kwinika in prison. General secretary, Tumelo Mogodiseng, said Kwinika was assaulted while in police custody and as a result, his arm was broken, his ear drum burst and his ribs were bruised. Mogodiseng said police officials who carried out the arrest and those who were part of the alleged assault "must be dealt with". In the past, the union was vocal about issues plaguing the South African Police Service and Mogodiseng claimed this was part of the reasons for the arrest. Earlier this year, they called for the removal of national police commissioner, General Khehla Sitole, saying the union had reached the end of the road with Sitole and that he "has taken the South African Police Service down the left lane". "We have been vocal about low morale in the police service and the removal of the police commissioner and this [arrest] may be as a result of our actions," Mogodiseng said. But Naidoo denied the allegations. "Police were busy with their own operations in Sunnyside," he said, adding that the area was notorious for illegal activities. "He was informed that he was being arrested on charges of drinking in public and that's when the resistance and assault happened."
