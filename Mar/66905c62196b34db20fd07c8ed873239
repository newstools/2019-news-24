An eyewitness has given News24 a dramatic account of the shooting outside Life Fourways Hospital in Johannesburg on Tuesday morning in which a woman was shot twice. He said the alleged shooter, aged 54, had been driving a white Range Rover from the direction of Cedar Lakes Estate when he suddenly parked his vehicle at a traffic circle, got out and shot the woman in the face twice while she was in her car. He apparently killed himself. The woman is believed to have been his partner.
