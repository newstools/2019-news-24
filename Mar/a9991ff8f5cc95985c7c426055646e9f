This after a man and woman attempted to rob an Uber driver in Zone 5, Langa, on Friday. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said the pair’s attempt was botched when they were chased by locals who phoned the police. A 23-year-old woman was arrested and is currently in custody, Van Wyk confirmed. “During her interview she informed the investigating officer she would identify the whereabouts of her accomplice whereafter she mentioned seven addresses where the other suspects could possibly be hiding out.  These addresses were visited but no arrest was made,” he said. “Further information was followed up [on Saturday] and another 26-year-old female suspect was arrested.” The suspects could be linked to 15 other Langa cases related to taxi robberies, Van Wyk said. “Investigations determined that fake accounts were created by the suspects for ordering the taxis.” The two, believed to be part of a syndicate, are expected in court once charged.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
