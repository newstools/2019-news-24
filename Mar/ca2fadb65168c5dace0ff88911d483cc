South African Police Service (SAPS) officers from different police stations in the Western Cape gathered, at the Mandela Park Stadium, Khayelitsha, on Saturday to voice their concerns over the lack of promotions in the service. The meeting formed part of the nationwide gathering by SAPS members. Nokuthula Ndzongana, the deputy chairperson of the South African Police Allied Workers Union (SAPAWU), said they decided to call a meeting because they were overlooked for promotions. She said the feels left out because promotions are given to special units within the police service. “There were about 2000 posts that were just given to special units and those coming from the college while most of us have long service in the police,” she said. Ndzongana said they are in the forefront because as police officers they are always first on the scene and that they are the most that get killed on the job. She said there are even police officers with degrees and diplomas who were not considered for promotions. “The posts should have been opened for everyone to apply but they were just filled and we do not know which criteria was used,” she said. Ndzongana accused the minister of police Bheki Cele of causing divisions between the officers. A police constable who did not want to be named said described the situation as “very unfair” to a lot of them. He said he has been a constable for a long time. He said they were not told anything about the new promotions and were given to special units who some of them do not even have long service. Police spokesperson Vish Naidoo said the concerns of the members were about promotions and salary grading. He said the problem was only in the Western Cape and KwaZulu Natal. He said Cele and the management met with station commanders and provincial commanders to address the issue. “The resolution was that a committee will be formed in the next three months to review these two policies,” he said. He added that this was communicated to the officers.
