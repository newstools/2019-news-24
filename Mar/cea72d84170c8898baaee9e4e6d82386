The University of Cape Town (UCT) council could not yet decide whether or not it should boycott Israeli universities, it said on Saturday. "Council did not adopt this resolution of the Senate. It was the view of the Council that a number of issues required clarification," Royston Pillay Registrar and Secretary to Council said. The university is considering a resolution of its Senate that will see it decide if it will enter into any formal relationships with Israeli academic institutions operating in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

"Council resolved to refer the matter back to the Senate." He said the council "separately resolved" to reaffirm its commitment to supporting the rights and freedom of all people recognised under international law. UCT condemned any acts that violate human rights and freedoms. Pillay said they also condemned atrocities and human rights violations perpetrated in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. "[We] call on all academics and academic institutions to support this resolution." Pillay said UCT reaffirmed its commitment to academic freedom. "[But we] reserve the right to dissociate itself from those academics and academic institutions that support (directly or indirectly) the violation of human rights and /or enable the violation of human rights."
