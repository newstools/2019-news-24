The ANC has turned to crowdfunding to raise funds for its elections campaign, the party's treasurer general, Paul Mashatile, announced on Thursday. The initiative was launched by the treasurer general on Thursday. Acting spokesperson Dakota Legoete said the fundraising method would allow ANC members, supporters and the South African public to "raise their hands and contribute towards a decisive victory in the upcoming elections on May 8". "The resources raised through this initiative will go towards campaign materials, such as posters, campaign meetings and canvassing, voter education, as well as elections day logistics, such as voter transport and information tables," he said. A donations call centre has also been set up.
