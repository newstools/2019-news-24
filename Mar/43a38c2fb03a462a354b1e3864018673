Patricia de Lille seems to be making good progress in increasing her party's membership. The Good leader has welcomed internationally acclaimed award-winning actor and a well-known musician and performer, Alistair Izobell, on board. De Lille announced Izobell's joining her Good party through a statement on Friday. "I would like to announce that a son of our soil has joined the GOOD movement," she said. "As a GOOD artist with over 30-years' experience, he has got a plan to fix the wrongs within the industry and to bring more opportunities to younger artists and provide mentorships to our talent," said De Lille.
