The awards recognises hard work done by some of the teachers and general staff at the school. SGB chairperson Mfusi Zonke said they always wanted to honour the work carried out by the teachers considering the conditions they work under. “We wanted to tell them that their efforts and determination have not gone unnoticed,” said Zonke. He said the teachers look after 1 600 learners daily. He described the figure as a “huge number of learners”. Despite that, Zonke says the teachers are always thriving. He said by awarding them they are also motivating them to do more. Principal Isaac Sijula said they believe in working as a unit. He said it is that unity that earned them recognition from the SGB. Sijula praised the SGB for motivating the staff. He said the school is experiencing a surge in the number of learners and that means they are doing something good. “The SGB saw we are doing something right and we are grateful for what they are doing for us,” he said. Talking on behalf of the staff, teacher Mncedisi Ngcwayi thanked the SGB for taking note of their hard work. “We thought no one was noticing what we are doing and we are grateful to the SGB for recognising our work,” he said.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
