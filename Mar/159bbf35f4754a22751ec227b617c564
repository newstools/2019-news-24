A multi-million rand Junxion Mall, in Phillipi, is expected to open its doors for trading next month. The R500million development project on the corner of Govan Mbeki Drive and New Eisleben Road began in February last year and will see some of the country’s leading retailers open new businesses in the area. Tomorrow, Friday 29 March, the construction steering committee is expected to hand over the keys to the mall management. Philippi Development Forum chairperson Monwabisi Mbaliswana praised the investors for having confidence in the people of Philippi. He described the mall as top-notch. “This is a first of its kind. All the well- known shops are going to be there. Our government is bringing services closer to the people. There is no need for people to take transport to go to Cape Town or Wynberg to pay their accounts,” he said. He said the construction of the mall has changed people’s bad perception about the area. “More than 500 job opportunities including cleaners, security, tellers and others will be available. And just in the construction phase there were 39 subcontractors hired and that created job opportunities to more than 2000 people,” he said. In terms of security, he assured customers of their safety. Resident Nosiseko Malgas from Browns Farm reiterated Mbaliswana’s sentiment that the opening of the mall will bring services closer to people. However, she said her concern is nepotism when it comes to hiring people. “I wish people can be hired based on merit rather than hiring them because he or she is connected to somebody else,” said Malgas. Mbaliswana stated that for job applications people can drop the CV in councillor Mboniswa Ncitha’s office in Philippi.
