The transcript was played in the North West High Court in Mmabatho on Tuesday, where Bylsma appeared. Bylsma previously pleaded not guilty to murdering Sharnelle Hough, 17, and Marna Engelbrecht, 16, in the early hours of Saturday, May 26, in the girls' hostel of Hoërskool Stella in the North West. In the recording, Bylsma can be heard saying: "And then I hanged her". He allegedly strangled the girls and tried to make their deaths look like suicide. Saunders and Bylsma were in a vehicle shortly after the bodies were discovered and Saunders spoke to him for a long time to find out how the girls had died. Bylsma's lawyer recused himself from the case on Thursday at the start of the trial. "It's the end of smooth sailing for me," his mother, Mercia, told YOU last Tuesday. "From here on, it's going to be a rough ride. But my boy is positive." Bylsma, who was arrested that evening, indicated at a court appearance in July that he didn't want to apply for bail out of fear for his own safety, YOU reported. The hearing continues on Wednesday.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
