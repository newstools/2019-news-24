A Stellenbosch University emeritus professor who allegedly called a restaurant employee the k-word has been charged with crimen injuria. Academic Leon de Kock, who wrote the recently released biography titled Andre P. Brink en die spel van die liefde, has been released on a warning after appearing in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court. Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk confirmed that a suspect had been arrested on Thursday, shortly after a female employee at an Observatory restaurant reported him to the police. "It has been alleged by the complainant, that while she was busy cleaning the restaurant, a 62-year-old male customer made racial and offensive remarks at her," Van Wyk said. A woman on social media identified the man as De Kock, saying he had called a woman the "k-word" after "sexually harassing another woman, insisting she wanted his babies and then calling her a stupid girl". According to the post, the employee had "dropped her mop and chased him". De Kock’s son Luke and daughter Charis commented on the post, apologising for the incident. According to Luke, De Kock has been referred for a psychiatric assessment. "I apologise unreservedly for his behaviour, but that was not my dad," he wrote. Stellenbosch University spokesperson Martin Viljoen on Tuesday confirmed the institution was currently investigating the complaints it had received about De Kock’s conduct. News24 attempted to reach De Kock for comment. This will be added once received. According to his biography on the Jonathan Ball Publishers’ website, De Kock – a literary translator, poet, writer and academic - has published more than 15 books. The company has been approached for comment, which will be published once obtained. Police have requested anyone who had witnessed the incident to contact the investigation officer Constable Dumetri Onverwaght on 021 486 2840.
