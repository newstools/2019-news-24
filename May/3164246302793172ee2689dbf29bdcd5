An eNCA news team came under attack in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday, the broadcaster is reporting. Reporter Sandy McCowen and camera operator Nceba Ntlanganiso said the vehicle they were travelling in was pelted with stones and rocks while they were in the suburb of Helenvale covering a story. The team was conducting interviews in the area following a tense situation involving residents marching against gangsterism. After interviewing one of the marchers, the eNCA news team was about to leave in their vehicle but was prevented from doing so by a minibus taxi which pulled up in front of them. McCowen told eNCA anchor Shahan Ramkissoon, that, as they were forced to stop, they saw a group of men approach and started throwing rocks at their vehicle. She said they then fled the scene, driving on the pavement. "While we were driving, we saw the taxi was turning and started following us out of Helenvale. We drove as fast as possible, driving through some red robots trying to get out and get away from this taxi as quickly as possible," said McCowen. She said they eventually drove to the nearest police station, where they were told by officials that they should have called them and asked to be escorted as tension were high in the area. On Sunday, a group of activists from the city's northern areas also marched in a bid to gain support for the anti-gangsterism fight, Port Elizabeth based newspaper The Herald reported on Monday. A series of videos posted to social media of the march show some people carrying guns, wearing balaclavas and bulletproof vests.
