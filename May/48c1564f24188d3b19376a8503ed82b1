A Cape Town man is expected to stand trial in the Western Cape High Court next week for allegedly dismembering his wife and leaving parts of her body in different locations in Khayelitsha. Goodman Nobade, dressed in a green tweed jacket, a striped shirt and dark pants, made a brief appearance in the high court on Monday morning before Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe. Salie-Hlophe indicated that, after a meeting in chambers, the parties decided that formal admissions would be exchanged and that the defence would decide whether to tender a plea explanation. Nobade will remain in custody until his trial starts in a week's time on May 20. He was taken away in shackles. Charges Nobade has been charged with murder, assault with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, and obstructing the course of justice. He is accused of murdering his wife Agnes Msiza. They were married in accordance with customary law. Further details are expected to emerge during the trial, but the indictment stated that Msiza had applied for an interim protection order against Nobade in September 2016. She is believed to have been murdered in their Mbethankunzi Street home in Site B seven months later. Msiza's cause of death could not be determined as only her head and upper leg were found in June 2017. The State alleges that Nobade covered up the murder by cleaning the crime scene, getting rid of his wife's body parts and giving various accounts to people about her disappearance. He was admitted to Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital last year for enquiries into whether he had any mental illness or defect, had the capacity to understand proceedings, and whether he should be held criminal responsibility.
