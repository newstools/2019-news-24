The row between muso couple Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha appears to be over after both artists agreed to counselling. Mandla "Mampintsha" Maphumulo was in the Pinetown Magistrate's Court for the assault of Gqom artist Bongekile "Babes Wodumo" Simelane, but they now look set to reconcile. The court heard that both parties had agreed to intervention from the Family and Marriage Society of SA (Famsa). The organisation provides counselling, education and training for South Africans who want help with relationship issues. A relaxed Wodumo, who was dressed in a black evening dress, earlier appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court for an assault matter and had to rush to Pinetown for the appearance. The couple appeared amicable but tense. They declined to say anything outside of court to the large group of journalists who asked for comment. Maphumulo's lawyer, Pat Magwaza, also declined to comment on the status of their relationship. Maphumulo was previously granted R2 000 bail. He was arrested after a video of him launching a physical attack on Simelane went viral. The court ordered him to have no contact with Simelane. However, since his previous court appearance, Maphumulo released a video on Instagram of a song called Khona Ingane Lay'Ndlini. The video featured Simelane, alongside DJ Tira and Campmaster. The couple are expected to return to the Pinetown Magistrate's Court on July 11. Magazine Move! reported earlier on Wednesday that Maphumulo had dropped the counter-charges of assault which he had laid against Simelane earlier this year. Simelane's other case in the Durban Magistrate's Court - where she and sister Nondumiso Simelane and fellow artist Tipcee (real name Thobeka Ndaba) are charged with common assault - was postponed to May 30. The three have been charged with common assault - a charge which KwaZulu-Natal businesswoman Nelisiwe Zondi laid in March.
