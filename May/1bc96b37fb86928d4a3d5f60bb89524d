SANBI
Kirstenbosch has won yet another gold medal at the 2019 Chelsea Flower Show. The
announcement was made today (Tuesday 21 May) at the annual Royal Horticultural
Society (RHS) Chelsea Flower Show, taking place in London until
Saturday 25 May. This is the
37th year that SANBI Kirstenbosch will be bringing home gold from this highly
anticipated event on the British calendar. Leon Kluge,
the designer behind Kirstenbosch’s 2019 exhibition titled ‘Mountains of
Abundance’ – created a contemporary hand-made three metre high slate mountain,
with one side depicting a silhouette of Table Mountain and the other of the
Magaliesburg. According
to a statement, the Kirstenbosch Chelsea Flower Show Exhibit has been proudly
representing South Africa’s diverse floral kingdom at the Chelsea Flower Show
for 44 years. “This
year’s exhibit was indeed a show-stopper with its cutting edge design featuring
a slate mountain, dotted with abstract waterfalls cascading from bright
larger-than-life traditional Ndebele hats, and masses of proteas, arums, restios and fynbos arranged as they occur together on the wild slopes of some
of South Africa’s mountains,” the statement read.
