One man was killed after a bakkie overturned and rolled several times while another victim sustained moderate injuries in KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday morning. Paramedics said they found the bakkie lying on its side on the R56 in Thornville, Pietermaritzburg. "Shortly after 07:30, paramedics from ER24 arrived on the scene where they found the bakkie lying on its side several meters into an open veld. Upon assessment, they found a man, believed to be 23 years old, next to the road," said ER24 spokesperson, Werner Vermaak. "Bystanders explained that they brought the man to the road following the crash. He was treated for injuries to his back and head." "Another man was found several meters away from the wreckage in the veld. Sadly, there was nothing that paramedics could do for him and he was declared dead on the scene." There was no certainty on who the driver or the passenger was. Vermaak said while it was not known what caused the accident, local authorities had attended to the scene and would conduct an investigation.
