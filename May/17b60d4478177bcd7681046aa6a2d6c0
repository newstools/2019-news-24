One person has been arrested and three injured following two separate accidents at the Kruger National Park within the space of two hours on Wednesday night. In a tweet on Thursday morning, the park posted pictures of a bakkie that had smashed through the wall of a guard house. An empty bottle of Castle Milk Stout can be seen on the back of the bakkie. The first crash, however, happened earlier in the evening, at around 21:00, at the Paul Kruger gate, according to Isaac Phaahla,Â general manager of communications and marketing at the Kruger National Park.

Number plates have been retrieved and Skukuza SAPS are investigating," Phaahla told News24. The second incident happened two hours later, at around 23:00. "The [bakkie] smashed through the gate and into the guard house. Three people were injured, one was ferried to hospital but has since been discharged and charged with driving under the influence and negligence as well as damage to property," Phaahla said.
