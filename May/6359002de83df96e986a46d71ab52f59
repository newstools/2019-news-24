A Port Elizabeth-based pilot who allegedly ran away after he crashed his Audi A4 into pedestrians, killing one, has been arrested and intends to apply for bail. Kelvin Zirema, 31, was identified as the driver of the vehicle involved in a crash in Beach Road, Humewood, in the early hours of Sunday. He was driving the vehicle in the right lane, travelling towards King's Beach, when he knocked into two pedestrians standing next to the island in the road at around 03:50, said Colonel Priscilla Naidu. "The driver lost control of the vehicle and collided with four other stationary vehicles near the Humewood Hotel. No one was in these vehicles at the time. The driver got out and ran away, but was arrested by police." The vehicle was towed to the pound for further investigation. Still in custody A video of the gruesome crash has been circulating on social media. Anthony Agbo, 35, a Nigerian national who had been in the country for just a few days, was killed. A woman from Zwide, 26, was seriously injured and is still in hospital. Zirema works at Helicopter Charter and Training, situated about 5km away from where the accident took place. The company declined to comment at this stage. Zirema appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Monday on charges of drunk driving, culpable homicide and reckless and/or negligent driving. He will remain in custody until his formal bail application on Thursday.
