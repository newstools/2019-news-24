A prominent Gugulethu businessman, Leon Gcina - popularly known as Pistos - was shot and killed in the early hours of Monday morning. The owner of the popularly known So Chillar, also known as Pitsos Lounge, in NY 112 was gunned down. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of murder has been opened for investigation for a shooting incident that occurred on Monday at NY 75 in Gugulethu. She said according to information a 51- year-old man was shot and fatally wounded by suspects (known to the police) who are yet to be arrested. Rwexana said circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation. In a statement the family said they were still shocked by the brutal and senseless killing of Gcina. The statement read: “On his way home from closing his business at about 03:00 he was brutally shot several times after entering his driveway at NY 75 in Gugulethu, and that the unknown gunmen fled in his car which was later discovered by the police”. The statement further read that the family would like to distance themselves from the “unfounded” statements that had been circulating on social media about the incident as any speculation could prejudice the case. The family described the case as “very sensitive” and “traumatic”. “This is very traumatic and painful for the family and the entire community, we urge anyone with information that may help with the case to contact the local police,” the family said in a statement.
