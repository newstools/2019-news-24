Cape Town residents were chasing their tails on Thursday over reports that their beloved furballs are banned from all beaches in the city. But Community Services and Health councillor Zahid Badroodien indicated that people were barking up the wrong tree and that dogs were indeed allowed at designated beaches (the list is below). He said the City's animal by-law made provision for free running, on-the-leash walks, and time limitation (when dogs are allowed during certain times) on beaches. When allocating these dog zones, the City considered the size of the beach, its environmentally sensitive nature, the recreational use of the space and the proximity to neighbouring "free-running" dog areas, or where dogs were allowed on a leash. Dogs and domestic animals were excluded from certain sections of the coast because of the bacteria in their faeces, the nuisance factor (where members of the public don’t want to be bothered by an animal invading their personal space) and the possible danger of conflict arising from dog fights. Another consideration was dogs chasing birds and other indigenous animals which lived in the dunes. "The coastline is a shared public asset and all members of the public are required to exercise due care, to avoid creating a negative impact on the environment and consideration for other users," said Badroodien. "This includes dog owners being aware of the areas where dogs are prohibited and acting responsibly with their dogs in permitted environments." Here is a list of beaches where your dogs and horses are welcome:
