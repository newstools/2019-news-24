The 400-strong group took the oath or affirmation, with some promising to hold the sixth democratically elected president accountable for his promises. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng presided over the ceremony. He had asked MPs to seriously consider the country's challenges in their meditation or prayer.
