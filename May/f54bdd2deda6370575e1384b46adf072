AT LEAST 10 medical practices in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro have been visited to crack down on fraud relating to the issuing of public driver’s permits. The traffic anticorruption law enforcement authorities, in a joint effort with health regulatory bodies, have visited these prac­tices. According to a statement issued by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), at least two suspects were arrested for allegedly practising medicine unlawfully, while two others were taken in for questioning. “Investigations are continuing and more arrests are expected. The crackdown was undertaken by the National Traffic Anticorruption Unit of the RTMC, in collaboration with the Health Professions Council of South Africa and the South African Medical Products Regulatory Authority, to deal with doctors who irregularly issue medical certificates to individuals seeking to apply for public driver’s permits,” said spokesperson, Simon Zwane. It is alleged that some doctors issue these certificates without subjecting patients to the necessary medical examination.
