The Democratic Alliance says it is "disturbed" by a video that shows hundreds of steel beds at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital stored outside. In a statement issued on Monday, DA MPL Jack Bloom said many of the beds look in good condition but will "deteriorate rapidly in unsheltered conditions". Bloom said the video was taken on Wednesday by a man who was visiting his son in the paediatric ward. "This is a clear waste of state assets as these beds should be put to good use instead of rusting outside. "There are hospitals that are short of beds where they could be used, or they could be donated to non-profit institutions," he said. The Department of Health has hit back however, saying the beds could not be distributed to other health facilities as they are unsafe. In a statement, the department said it replaced cot beds at the hospital with high low beds to "mitigate against patients falls and patients banging themselves against the steel structure of the beds". "In order to keep up with standard of managing compromised patients, in 2016/17 financial year, management took a decision to replace the beds in the medical, surgical and maternity wards." The process of disposing these steel beds was then initiated and was still ongoing, the department said. "It must be noted that the Gauteng health department HoD, Professor Mkhululi Lukhele did not accede to the distribution of these unsafe beds to other health facilities," the statement reads.
