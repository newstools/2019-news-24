With the flow of traffic on roads having increased dramatically in recent years, the City has made a concerted effort to prioritise the construction of sidewalks and traffic calming measures. According to Mayco member for urban management, Grant Twigg a number of residents rely on their feet to get where they are going. “In the interest of pedestrian safety, these safety measures were prioritised to enhance the comfort and safe passage for residents,” he said. Ward projects were prioritised with an amount of close to R1m being spent on the construction of sidewalks and about R2m on traffic calming measures. The aim is to escalate safety measures for residents across communities. The construction of sidewalks is also a means of encouraging residents to walk more, thereby enabling them to engage in a somewhat healthier lifestyle. “Raised intersections and speed humps regulate reckless driving behaviour and they enhance the improvement of road safety for residents and motorists. There is a demand for the construction of pavements in our communities especially for those who make use of public transport. I am excited to announce these improvements that have been made by the City in the interest of safety of our residents, especially children who walk to and from school,” said Twigg.
