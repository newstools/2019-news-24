A policeman was killed while pursuing a house robber on a Stellenbosch farm, Western Cape police said on Thursday. The constable, aged 31, had been part of the Stellenbosch Crime Prevention Unit, said police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk. On Wednesday, police received information about the planned house robbery but they didn't know the name of the farm. They patrolled the area and spotted a group of people who appeared suspicious. While pursuing the group at around 21:50, the constable was shot and killed. "It was then established that the house robbery was indeed committed at 20:00 at a farm near Vlottenburg. The suspects managed to evade arrest and are being sought," said Van Wyk. Netwerk24Â reported that the policeman was shot from behind and that his service pistol is believed to have been found next to him. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) indicated it will register a discharge of a police firearm case. "The report received is that there was a discharge of police firearms after they shot at unknown suspects who had killed a police officer. We are not aware of anyone having sustained any injuries," IPID spokesperson Moses Dlamini said. He said that should more information come to the fore as to whether the policeman was shot by his colleagues, or that the suspect who was shot at sustained injuries, they would then investigate that. Dlamini said a post-mortem on Friday might shed more light. "At this stage we are conducting a preliminary investigation." Western Cape Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula conveyed his condolences to the policeman's loved ones and colleagues.
