Customers at the Bedfordview licencing department were left shocked last Monday after an official made racial slurs. Motivational speaker Gavin Sharples, who recorded the incident on video, said the official was speaking to another customer "like he was sub-human". Sharples said the official called a waiting customer "stupid". He said he felt obliged to say something. "I said excuse me, can you put some love in your heart and treat this young man with a bit of kindness," he recalled. Sharples said the official then turned to him and said: "I'm sick of you people." The video shows the official standing in the waiting area and saying: "You can do whatever." That is when Sharples asked to speak to his supervisor. When Sharples approached the supervisor, the official can be heard saying "you white people... I don't like you". "The supervisor asked me to put the complaint in writing," Sharples said. "Someone needs to stand up so that this doesn't affect others." Sharples then called the police and opened a case of crimen injuria. Bedforview police spokesperson Captain André de Jager confirmed to News24 that the case had been opened for investigation. The City of Ekurhuleni said it was aware of the existence of the "racial attack" video."The City of Ekurhuleni assures the public that the matter is viewed in a serious light. An investigation has been instituted to get to the bottom of this," spokesperson Themba Gadebe said. Sharples said he had also laid a complaint with the Human Rights Commission.
