Two of the three suspects who robbed a woman of cash and jewellery in a Johannesburg driveway have been apprehended. The incident took place in Nottingham Road, Kensington, on Wednesday morning. Gauteng police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini told News24 that K9 members spotted the suspects in their Polo Vivo in Louis Botha Avenue. "A shootout ensued when police confronted them, until their vehicle hit a wall," Dlamini said. Two of the suspects were arrested. They sustained bullet wounds and were under guard in hospital. The third suspect managed to escape, Dlamini said. "Two pistols were recovered, as well as cash stolen from a woman at Bruma. Their gateway vehicle had been hijacked in Sandton." None of the police officers were injured during the shootout. Dlamini said a case of armed robbery, attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms, and possession of a stolen vehicle were being investigated.
