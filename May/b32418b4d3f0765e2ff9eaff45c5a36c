ANC deputy president David Mabuza is set to be sworn in as a member of Parliament in Pretoria on Tuesday afternoon, paving the way for a possible appointment as President Cyril Ramaphosa's state deputy. Last Wednesday, just hours before MPs were due to be sworn in, the presidency in the governing party sent out a statement announcing that Mabuza had requested that his swearing-in be postponed. Mabuza wanted to clear his name with the party's integrity commission after he had been red-flagged ahead of the May 8 elections. The integrity commission was tasked with probing a number of controversial ANC members who were elected to the party's lists for Parliament and provincial legislatures. The inclusion of party members who faced damning court judgments or serious concerns of state capture, including Nomvula Mokonyane, Bathabile Dlamini and Malusi Gigaba among others, led to an uproar of criticism. Mabuza appeared before the commission on Friday to hear the claims against him and to plead his case. READ:Â Major changes expected at ANC headquarters due to Ramaphosa's Cabinet appointments On Tuesday morning, the ANC sent out a statement confirming Mabuza's swearing in. Spokesperson Pule Mabe said the integrity commission process had been concluded. "The ANC commends the Deputy President on the exemplary position he has taken and for putting the interests and integrity of the ANC first," read the statement. This move will allow Ramaphosa to appoint Mabuza as his deputy in the Union Buildings, as it is a constitutional requirement that the national deputy president be a member of Parliament. It was widely speculated that Ramaphosa would name his Cabinet soon after his inauguration at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday, but his office announced on Monday that he would reveal his executive later this week. It's believed Mabuza's attempt to clear his name was one of the matters holding up Ramaphosa.
