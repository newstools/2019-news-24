A North West woman is in a serious but stable condition after her ex-boyfriend allegedly shot and wounded her and her new partner in their home near Vryburg on Friday. Police say the 34-year-old suspect, who has since been arrested, went to the pair's home where he shot them "in their upper bodies". In a statement on Sunday, police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Amanda Funani said the jilted man is also alleged to have attacked the male victim with a panga, hitting him on the head after having shot him. "The duo were rushed to the district hospital, where the ex-girlfriend is in a serious but stable condition," says Funani. The suspect faces two counts of attempted murder.  He is expected to appear in the Ganyesa Magistrate's Court on Monday.
