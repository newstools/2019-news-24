Dear editor I have argued in News24 and other media outlets that DA supporters are making a mistake to vote ANC as a way of supporting President Cyril Ramaphosa. I have had numerous requests to explain this and therefore welcome the opportunity to briefly do so here. There is no question that the country needs Cyril Ramaphosa and preferably a strong Cyril Ramaphosa. It is not going to be easy but a strong Cyril can clean up the ANC. But our national problems are not internally resolvable and the country and Cyril need a strong DA. Cyril with ANC support and support from a strong DA forming a government of national unity and including smart committed business people and the promise of international investment, are needed to take us into an IMF arrangement which will assist us into making the essential structural reforms and policy changes which won't otherwise happen. The further importance of Cyril and a smart dozen or so around him, is that they will see the need for international involvement along these lines. This is the only sense in which the election is relevant to finding answers to the critical social and economic situation we face as a people and a country.
