Kidnapped KwaZulu-Natal south coast beekeeper and golfer Yzelle Greyling refuses to be intimidated after her ordeal and is back at work braving swarms of bees after her rescue. "I'm back to catching bees again because I don't want them (the kidnappers) to scare me," Greyling told News24 by phone on Tuesday. "But my son does it (bee catching) with me now â€“ no more funny addresses in funny places." Greyling was pounced on while removing bees near Umzumbe on May 3, on the KZN south coast, and stuffed into a white Volkswagen Golf. KZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said she was on a call-out and that people were going to show her a beehive at Fairview Mission in Umzumbe. She was with two workers when they were confronted by three men at around 09:15. On the way to the bees, one of the men pulled out a firearm and threatened her. The workers were ordered to sit down and their hands were tied while she was forced into the boot of the VW Golf. She was found physically unharmed later that day in Southport, after a massive search and rescue operation. Three arrested Mbele said three people, aged 29, 47 and 35, were arrested after an intensive investigation by the Port Shepstone branch of the Hawks, Crime Intelligence, search and rescue and detectives. Farm watch and local security companies also helped. Greyling's golfing friends also put out pleas for any sightings of her.   The three people made their first court appearance on May 6, and the case was postponed to Wednesday, May 15, in the Port Shepstone Magistrate's Court. Greyling said that further details of their motive could be revealed during their bail application, but for now, she is coming to terms with what happened. "To be stuck in the boot of the car for about nine hours is not the most fun thing I've done in my life." She asked that the police and the K9 Unit get special praise for their work in her case.
