The Provincial Parliament of the Western Cape has held its first session today (Wednesday 22 May), where DA candidate Alan Winde has officially been elected and sworn in as the premier. An election was held with a secret ballot after the ANC contested the election by nominating Cameron Dugmore. Any sworn in member of the provincial parliament is eligible to become the premier, as long as they are nominated by another member of the house in the correct manner. Winde won with a total of 24 votes, making up 60% of the vote, while Dugmore obtained 10 votes, with six ballots being spoilt. The official first sitting of the sixth provincial parliament took place following the national and provincial election on Wednesday 8 May. Other members, both new and returning, representing various parties were also sworn in as official members of the house.
