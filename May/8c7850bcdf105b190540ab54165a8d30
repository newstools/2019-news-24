A family of three escaped unharmed when armed men confronted them in their driveway in Vorna Valley, Midrand, on Saturday. However, there was "extensive damage" to the Audi they travelled in. CCTV footage of the incident shows a dark-coloured SUV following the Audi before two men jump out, brandishing firearms. Almost immediately, the driver of the Audi turns and speeds off. "Let me take this opportunity to explain that my husband was armed, but chose not to use his arms," Melissa Worman posted on the Intelligence Bureau SA Facebook page.

She added that their two-year-old was in the vehicle with them at the time. Worman went on to explain that pulling into their driveway was sometimes "tricky". "There was no way of getting out of this any better than we didâ€¦ the damages done [were] unavoidable, even with the sharpest driver," she said in the post. Attempts to reach police were unsuccessful Worman has not responded to News24's attempt to get her comment via Facebook.
