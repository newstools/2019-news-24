A life taken too soon. A life taken at its peak." Fleetwatch wrote on its Facebook page: "[A]t 05:00 [on Sunday], [the truck] was passing through De Doorns when some criminals threw a boulder from a bridge at his truck. The boulder hit his windscreen, smashed through it and hit the driver who then lost control of the vehicle.

Some went for the goods on the trailer while others climbed into the cab to steal whatever they could lay their hands on."   According to Fleetwatch, looters also stole the entire load. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa confirmed the incident to Netwerk24, saying: "Someone apparently threw an object through the windscreen of the truck after which the driver lost control and veered off the road. He (the driver) was killed. His assistant was injured." Gavin Kelly, CEO of the Road Freight Association, told Netwerk24 that residents of a nearby informal settlement looted the wreck of the truck. "These incidents happen frequently and it is concerning that this type of lawlessness is allowed. It is shocking what these people do to one another," he reportedly said. On Twitter, video footage of the incident emerged.
