20 students in India killed themselves last week after an
IT glitch reportedly led to them receiving results indicating that they’d
failed their exams. Almost one million students wrote the exam in February and
March in Telangana State and 350 000 youngsters reportedly failed, Fox
News reports. Widespread protest from parents, student groups and
political parties caused the local
government to investigate the issue. “There were technical glitches in the software,” N.
Narayana, president of a parents association, told the Indian
Express. “It appears the whole process was full of mistakes.
Unfortunately, due to these mistakes, students who failed are taking their
lives.” Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao of Telangana told local
media that they’re currently re-counting and re-verifying the exam scripts of
those who failed and has begged students not to take their own lives, New
York Post reports. “In the first year,
my son topped the exams, but now his marks are in single digits. I don’t know
what to do,” said one parent during a protest. “I have assured him that everything will be sorted out. But
what if he too harms himself?” In one extreme case a student named Sirisha, who failed
biology, set herself on fire at home, while another boy threw himself in front
of a train. This is the highest number of exam-related suicides in four
years in India. Sources: News.com.au,
