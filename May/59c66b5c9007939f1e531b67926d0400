Six weeks after a serious car accident left him paralysed, a 41-year-old man from Middelburg in Mpumalanga has died in Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg. Trevor Roberts’ wife, Suzette (39), spent the afternoon before his death by his side in a rehabilitation centre in Auckland Park, Joburg. He died later that evening on 1 May due to heart failure. “He looked fantastic and was positive about the future,” she says. He also told her that when he was eventually discharged, there were so many things he’d be able to do, she recalls of their last conversation. But later that evening, Trevor complained of a pain in his chest. He was taken to the Milpark hospital where he died on arrival from heart failure. In the accident, which happened on 22 March, Trevor fractured a vertebra in his neck, as well as his left arm. He was travelling in his employer’s bakkie when a burst tyre caused him to crash into a tree. He was transported to Milpark hospital by helicopter where he underwent an operation on his neck. But his injuries left him paralysed from the waist down. A heartbroken Suzette says besides the fact that his untimely death has left her reeling, she’s also anxious about how she’ll cover his cremation costs. “There’s a company here in Middelburg that charges R18 000 but I don’t have such money. I’m going to ask around in other towns to find a cheaper price. He was the breadwinner and never had a funeral policy.”  The pair celebrated their second wedding anniversary in April this year. Trevor has two sons – aged 17 and 11 – from a previous marriage and Suzette has twin boys and a 13-year-old daughter. “You think of the good memories and you know you have to move on. But it doesn’t take away those worries about the future,” she says.
