The getaway vehicle used by gunmen who robbed a number of international students at the Viva Foundation School in Mamelodi East on Monday has been found. Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela told News24 that the vehicle had been discovered abandoned at the Mahube Valley Mall, also situated in Mamelodi East, on Tuesday morning. Mawela said a forensics team was combing the vehicle for DNA evidence that would help trace the suspects. "I have no doubt in my mind, with the team that is assembled for this case, they will crack it very soon," he said. Following the robbery on Monday around 12:10, police put together a team of experienced detectives, supported by forensics and intelligence, to bring the suspects to book.

The suspects were waiting for them at the school's entrance. "It means somebody with information informed them. This was not an opportunistic crime. They came specifically for this, even the car they used, they removed the number plates. They were prepared to commit this crime," Mawela said. The robbed students were at the school for an outreach programme, accompanied by two professors. "It is alleged that a group of not less than five armed suspects accosted the visitors and robbed them of personal belongings, including: laptops, cellphones, cameras, passports, plane tickets, bags and US dollars," police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said in a statement on Monday. During the robbery, a school teacher was pistol-whipped and later a community member was struck by a stray bullet as the suspects fired shots while fleeing the scene.
