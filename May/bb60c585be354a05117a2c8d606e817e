Fredie Blom’s 115-year-old eyes have never worn spectacles, but he was used to squinting through the snow as he watched his favourite programmes on his ancient TV. But this will soon be a thing of the past after the man believed to be the oldest living person in the world was donated two flats screen TV sets as late birthday gifts. "It’s this big," Blom said, stretching his arms as wide as he could. "I can’t wait for it to be set up. I am so happy. This has been a wonderful birthday surprise." Although not yet certified the world’s oldest living man by Guinness World Records, Blom was born in Adelaide in the Eastern Cape on May 8, 1904. He has two ID documents – the old green book and a smart card – which confirm his date of birth. The oupa who moved to Cape Town as a young man to find work, now lives in Delft with his wife Jeanette. News24 last week reported that she had hoped to one day buy her husband of 43 years a flat screen TV. He enjoyed watching soapies and cartoons but the picture quality at times was so bad he could barely see what was happening on the screen, she lamented. An elated Jeanette told News24 it felt like it was her own birthday when she heard not one, but two TV sets were being sponsored to her by people who had read their story. "I don’t know what to say except thank you. Where are we even going to put these big TV sets?" she said, laughing. The couple’s home is in the process of being painted by volunteers. Blom watches from the garden, itching to pick up a brush and help. "I can also do that. There’s nothing wrong with these hands," he insisted. Blom's birthday was celebrated on Thursday with a party at the local civic centre. "Everyone made such a fuss. I didn't like that. But it was a nice event, so much food and people. I ate so lekker and I spoke to so many people. I liked when everyone sang for me," Blom said, beaming.
