President Cyril Ramaphosa left South Africa's collective jaw hanging on Wednesday evening when he announced that Good party leader and former Cape Town mayor, Patricia de Lille, would be assuming the role of Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure. It didn't take long for ''Aunty Pat'' and ''Patricia de Lille'' to trend on Twitter. Here are some of the reactions from South African across the political spectrum: Former DA member, Lindiwe Mazibuko congratulated her former party colleague.  Chester Missing congratulated the ''Minister of Floor Crossings''.  Gareth Van Onselen, head of politics and governance at the Institute of Race Relations got snarky about De Lille's history of political affiliation.  Sane Sidimba saw things differently.  Siphumelele Zondi, producer and anchor of the Network on SABC made some interesting observations.  Ranjeni Munusamy, associate editor for analysis at Tiso Blackstar had an unique take.  Sanef deputy chair, Katy Katopodis wondered if the President was sending the DA a message.  POWERtalk on Powerfm987 host and broadcast journalist, Aldrin Sampear, suggested De Lille walking by DA leader Mmusi Maimane might be awkward.  Former DA leader and Western Cape Premier, Helen Zille remains unshaken.  Brett Herron, GOOD secretary-general, in a statement, welcomed the appointment. ''We said when good people do nothing, that allows corruption and wrongdoing to prosper. It is thus entirely appropriate that we support our leader’s appointment to the Cabinet. We are walking the talk. Our Good leader has been asked to serve our country and we can only respond by saying a good person has been asked to do something,'' said Herron. He added that ''the President has recognised the commitment and track record of a great South African and we support her appointment and the contribution she’s been asked to make. GOOD will remain an opposition party in the National Assembly and the provincial legislature.'' ''We wish her well in her new role.''
