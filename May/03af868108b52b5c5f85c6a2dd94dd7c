Ramadan is about caring and sharing and that is exactly what Nakhlistan stands for. In 1984 Shukoor Mowzer and two friends realised that in the Athlone area where they were living, some of the residents did not have food for Eid celebrations and this is how Nakhlistan was born. With only two pots of food being cooked using donations from family and friends, 35 years later, Nakhlistan will again cook 169 130l pots of Aknie to feed over 85 000 less fortunate people in the Western Cape, on the day of Eidul Fitr. That is why they chose the name Nakhlistan, a Persian word which means “oasis and sustenance”. Nakhlistan pioneered the cooking of these huge pots of food on a wood fire and is pleased to see how other organisations are following suit. Nakhlistan, even though it is Muslim-based, caters for all the needy in the Western Cape, no matter their religious or cultural background. “Muslims are obliged to pay alms to the needy and during the month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from before sunrise to after sunset, Nakhlistan is that vehicle to distribute these alms via food parcels and cooking big pots of Aknie, an aromatic meat, potatoes and rice dish,” says Fatima Allie, Nakhlistan spokesperson. “Hundreds of people witness this cooking phenomenon, the night before Eidul Fitr and this year it is Tuesday 4 June at 20:00 at the Callies Rugby Field in Noll Avenue, Rylands Estate to experience how four tons of meat, (almost four) tons of rice, three tons of potatoes and two tons of onions together with spices is cooked on a wood fire.” Volunteers assist with the cooking of the food. “The smell of the burning wood, the steam and aroma from the huge pots, are a sight to behold,” she says. The organisation will distribute the food to Hanover Park, Newfields, Manenberg, Kensington, Factreton, Ocean View, Sherwood Park, Vrygrond, Lavender Hill, Sea Winds, Mandalay, Hill View, St. Montague Village, Cafda, Kewtown, Athlone, Mowbray, Masiphumelele, Philippi, Heideveld, Capricorn, Crossroads, Langa, Gugulethu, Nyanga, Atlantis, KalbasKraal, Dunoon, Khayelitsha,  Bonteheuwel, Valhalla Park, Garden Village, Kriefgat, Macassar, Blackheath, Sarepta, Blue Downs, Belhar, Delft, Blikkiesdorp, Hout Bay, Clarkes Estate, Elsies Rivier, Uitsig, Chattsworth, Ruyterwacht, Bishop Lavis West, Victor Verster Prison and Old Age Homes. “This year, Ramadan is during the harsh Cape Winter months and over and above the cooking of the big pots of food for Eidul Fitr distribution, Nakhlistan also hand out soup, sandwiches and blankets to areas affected by the winter weather. Another project of Nakhlistan is its operational Soup Kitchen in Gaza, Palestine,” says Allie. “Nakhlistan says Shukran, Thank You, Tramakassie, Dankie and Nkosi to our loyal community, donors, sponsors, businesses and volunteers for their constant support over the past 35 years.” The organisation is operational throughout the year.
