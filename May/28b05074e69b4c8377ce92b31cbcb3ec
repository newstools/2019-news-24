A 15-year-old has been arrested in connection with the fatal stabbing of a fellow pupil at a school in Ga-Mamabolo, outside Polokwane on Tuesday, police have said. The incident happened just before 10:30. The suspect is alleged to have stabbed the fellow pupil, 16, during a fight. "It is alleged that the two learners had a fight while playing within the school premises and subsequently, the suspect produced a sharp instrument and stabbed the deceased before fleeing from the scene," said provincial police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. The 16-year-old was taken to hospital, but declared dead on arrival. "The police were notified [and] responded immediately and a manhunt for the suspect ensued until he was arrested from his hideout in the area." Police then conducted preliminary investigations which led them to a spot where the murder weapon was hidden on top of a small hill outside the village. Ngoepe said the suspect will be appearing in court soon on a charge of murder.
