Police in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni are searching for suspected vigilantes who murdered a man they believe had robbed people in the Qalabusha informal settlement. The suspects are alleged to have assaulted the man before setting him alight. "A resident alerted police when he heard a loud noise. When he went to go check, he noticed a group of people who were beating up a suspect," said police spokesperson Sergeant Constance Moalusi. "He later noticed flames coming up." The incident happened on Monday. When police arrived at the scene, the man was beneath a pile of burning tyres. "The Daveyton station commander condemns the behaviour of the community in taking the law into their own hands by resorting to mob justice," Moalusi added. Police have asked anyone with information of the incident to contact them.
