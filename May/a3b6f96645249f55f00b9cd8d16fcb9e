The Western Cape High Court, on Monday, found Constantia businessman Rob Packham guilty of killing his wife Gill in February 2018 and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by setting her car and body alight. Packham stood expressionless in the dock as Judge Elize Steyn handed down the judgment. In her judgment, Steyn said:Â  "... the accused was a crafty, competent deceiver who was living what has shown to be a selfish, destructive life... the accused has shown himself to be an accomplished liar and deceiver who deceived his wife and to an extent, his paramour, as well as his family." She found that the totality of evidence pointed overwhelmingly to his guilt and that the State had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
