One man was killed and 22 others injured on Wednesday morning when a truck overturned on the R614 outside of Wartburg, KwaZulu-Natal. ER24 and other emergency services arrived on the scene around 07:30 to find a truck lying on its roof on the side of the road. Russel Meiring, communications officer for ER24, said in a statement that "it is believed that the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing it to roll". According to Meiring, the passengers, who had been on the back of the truck, were found scattered around the accident scene. Emergency personnel assessed the patients and found that one man had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. He was subsequently declared dead on the scene. Meiring said 22 other people were attended to by emergency personnel on the scene. Two men were found to be in a critical condition, while twenty others sustained minor to moderate injuries. Paramedics treated them and provided the two critically injured men with advanced life support. "Once treated, one of the critically injured patients was airlifted by a private medical helicopter to Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg, while the remaining victims were transported by ambulances to various hospitals," Meiring said. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24Â on Twitter
