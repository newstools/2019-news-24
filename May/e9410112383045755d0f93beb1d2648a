Two Free State municipal officials appeared separately in the Bethlehem Regional Court on Monday on charges of fraud, corruption and defeating the ends of justice. Mbongiseni Solomon Nyembe was arrested by the Hawks' National Clean Audit Task Team for allegedly contravening the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) for the period of 2014 to 2015. The 47-year-old is currently the acting manager of the Maluti a Phofung Municipality which was placed under administration in February last year after the municipality went "bankrupt". Four other senior officials and a director of a private company previously appeared in the Phuthaditjhaba Magistrate's Court in December for allegedly defrauding the bankrupt municipality in the Free State. The five suspects allegedly conspired and colluded during October 2016 and awarded company Zero Tolerance a tender to provide protection and security services to the municipality without following the correct supply chain management processes in terms of Municipal Finance Management Act, News24 earlier reported.
