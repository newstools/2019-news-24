A mother of three – while
being rushed to hospital by her partner, with their children in the back seat –
delivered her baby in the front seat which was all captured on camera. According to BET,
Mike Anthony Addison from Nevada was driving his partner, Rudy Napier, to
what was meant to be her last prenatal check-up when the unthinkable happened
and their daughter arrived sooner than expected. The video which has since gone viral on
social media with over 1 million views, shows 10-year-old Jayden capturing the
trip to the hospital in anticipation of his sister’s arrival – oblivious to
what would transpire in the next seconds. “Hey, Jolee, it's your father. Just want to
let you know you're making a grand presence in my car,” Mike can be heard
saying jokingly to the camera. But everything took a sudden turn when Rudy
started pushing and went into labour as all three of her child went panicked
watching their mother deliver their soon-to-be baby sister. Speaking to news outlet
Fox 5, Rudy recalled Mike asking her if she could “hold it?”, to which she
responded with a distressed, “No!” “So I just pushed and I pushed. I couldn't
take it anymore and that's when her head popped out,” she said. WARNING
