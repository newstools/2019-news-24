This week on POLOTIKI, the spotlight is on the National Assembly as the next chapter in South African politics unfolds with Cyril Ramaphosa elected unopposed as the president of the republic. But the day was not without drama. Deputy President David Mabuza requested the postponement of his swearing-in, following allegations that he had brought the ANC into disrepute.

Mmusi Maimane addressed the issue and said it would be referred to the party's federal executive council.  Once you've listened, share the podcast and let us know what you think.
