As part of his first order of business following his formal election and inauguration, premier Alan Winde on Thursday announced his cabinet of provincial ministers. With Dan Plato moving to municipal government, Donald Grant not returning to provincial parliament and Winde becoming premier, three new ministers have joined his cabinet. At his inauguration on Wednesday last week, Winde said his cabinet would undergo a lifestyle audit. He further commented that although former transport and public works provincial minister, Donald Grant would not be joining his cabinet, that he would continue to assist him and the cabinet in fulfilling their mandates. Winde said: “These ministers have all agreed and support my decision to undergo a lifestyle audit as part of my pledge to build on our good governance track record by setting a new standard for anti-corruption. We have done this because we believe that as public representatives, we must uphold the highest standards of integrity in the execution of our offices. These audits will be performed now and again at the end of the term,” said Winde. “Now the hard work begins. Together, we are committed to delivering better services, better opportunities and zero tolerance for corruption to all the residents of our province and I wish this broader team and all Western Cape Government employees, well in the execution of their duties in the term ahead.” Winde has said that he will look to reduce the number of portfolios instituted by his predecessors. Public transport and economic challenges are among the first issues Winde hopes to tackle. He further emphasised the need for all spheres of government to work together. Some of the returning ministers include Doctor Nomafrench Mbombo, who remains minister for health and will continue to strengthen projects initiated. “We wish to congratulate Dr Mbombo on her appointment for a second term and value her thorough knowledge of our health system and strategies. “The Western Cape Department of Health looks forward to another term under Dr Mbombo’s leadership to continue strengthening our service delivery through focused and innovative initiatives,” said Doctor Beth Engelbrecht, head of the Western Cape Department of Health in a statement. Former minister for social development Albert Fritz is now the minister for community safety. Fritz previously served as minister for community safety between 2010 and 2011. Fritz said in a statement: “I am incredibly passionate about ensuring the safety of the people of our province. Too many of us lie awake at night worried about the dangers that lurk outside and threaten us and our families. I will work with Premier Winde to implement a provincial police force to improve the police to population ratio in the Western Cape and to improve the accountability and oversight of the police.” Anton Bredell remains minister for local government, environmental affairs and development for a third term. He said in a statement: “It is an honour to be asked to continue to serve the people in this capacity. Me and my team will continue to drive programmes of good governance and improved service delivery across all communities in our province. We will continue to deliver on our promise to improve the lives of all citizens, whether it relates to managing disasters or whether it is in relation with planning for climate change. I will serve with humility and at all times give my best.” The ministers are as follows: . Transport and Public Works: Bonginkosi Madikizela . Community Safety: Albert Fritz . Health: Nomafrench Mbombo . Education: Debbie Schäfer . Agriculture: Ivan Meyer . Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning: Anton Bredell .
