FIVE dancers from the McWilliams Academy of Dance in Port Elizabeth represented South Africa at the World Irish Dance Championships in Greensboro, North Carolina, from April 14 to 21. Shanna du Plessis (11), Irene Pitsiladi (15), Channaed Oosthuizen (15), Carma Stephenson (17) and Courtney Pearce (26) qualified at the SA Nationals to compete at this prestigious event. The World Irish Dancing Championships have been called the Olympics of Irish dancing and they take place over Easter weekend in a different city every year. Over their 49-year history, this marks only the third time that they have been held in the United States. Worlds 2020 will be held in Dublin, Ireland for its 50th anniversary. More than 5 000 dancers competed against the best of the best in Irish dance in age categories from under-11 to seniors over-23. Seven judges adjudicated each dance by looking at complexity of steps, posture, height of leaps, height of legs with kicks, turnout of the feet and endurance throughout the dance. McWilliams Academy of Dance owner, Jennifer McWilliams, said, “Being selected to compete at the World Championships is every Irish dancer’s dream. “As dancers living in an ‘Irish dance developing country’, it is also a wonderful opportunity to see the very best dancers in the world.” The dancers are all back from the USA and despite a bit of jet lag have started practising for their upcoming competition to be held in Port Elizabeth at the Savoy Theatre on May 18.
