Commuters in the eThekwini Metro area will be faced with heavy congestion on Thursday morning as Department of Water and Sanitation workers resume their strike in all parts of the city. Reports of blocked roads poured in from just after 08:00, with main roads targeted by the disgruntled workers. The workers claim the municipality recently hired members of the MK Veterans on a higher wage scale. They have called for their salaries to be upgraded to the same level. The M7 Durban bound has been blocked by department trucks, while eyewitnesses have reported seeing 10 department trucks drive through Pineridge in Pinetown.  Another 20 trucks were spotted moving through Otto Volek Road in New Germany. Trucks are confirmed to be blocking traffic on the north-bound lane on the busy N2 before Spaghetti Junction.
