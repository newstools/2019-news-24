Believed to be the oldest man alive, Fredie Blom - an oupa from Delft on the Cape Flats - celebrated his 115th birthday on election day. On Thursday, he was honoured with a celebration at his local civic centre. Blom says the secret to a long life is to "honour your father and your mother". He has not yet been recognised by the Guinness World Records as the world's oldest man, despite them being informed that a potential record holder may be living in Cape Town. Masazo Nonaka, who held the title of oldest living man, died in January at his home in Japan. He was 113 years and 179 days old.
