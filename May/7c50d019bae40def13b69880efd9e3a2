EFF leader Julius Malema has warned President-elect Cyril Ramaphosa against appointing Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan into his cabinet. Malema's warning comes after Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found Gordhan guilty of "improper conduct" over his approval of then-deputy SA Revenue Services Commissioner Ivan Pillay's early retirement and payout. Malema told members of the media on Saturday, ahead of Ramaphosa's presidential inauguration, that if Gordhan was an honourable man he would respect Mkhwebane's findings.
