Jolene Alterskye, the former girlfriend of convicted killer Jason Rohde, faces the possibility of a contempt of court case over comments she made about his trial, and later apologised for. Rohde was sentenced in February to an effective 20 years in jail for killing his wife Susan, which he is directly taking to the Supreme Court of Appeal. After the sentencing, Alterskye slammed the detectives involved in his investigation, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), the justice system and Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe. In a text message, she accused the State and judge of being on the "same team" and cast doubt on the integrity of the investigation, the Weekend Argus reported.
