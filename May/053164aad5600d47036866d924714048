Two American brothers were found dead and floating
face-down in the pool at their apartment complex after they reportedly snuck
out of their home for a late-night swim. Six-year-old Ja’Kye Joseph and five-year-old Branario Minto
from Florida, were discovered by neighbours on Wednesday 22 May at Palms
Apartment Complex in North Lauderdale where they lived, People
reports. “I ran over there and saw two children laying on the side
of the pool, the kids were on the floor and they were [being given] CPR,” a
devastated neighbour told local media. The youngsters’ mom, Wildine Joseph, was reportedly asleep
when the incident occurred, Daily
Mail
reports. According to the Broward Sheriff's Office, family members
tried to resuscitate the boys until the ambulance arrived. The two were then transported to Northwest Medical Centre
where they were pronounced dead. Wildine said her sons, who were unable to swim, must have
managed to jump the fence to get into the pool area. “I’m so sorry. If I was there, I could have saved them on
time,” Wildine told Local
10
News. “I will always miss my babies. I’m sorry, Ja’Kye. I’m sorry, Branario.” Police are reportedly investigating the incident. Sources: People, The
