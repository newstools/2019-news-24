IN a shocking turn of events, two family members of slain Ideal’s Sand owner Farhaad Moosa were arrested over the weekend in connection with the business owner’s murder. It was previously alleged that Moosa had fallen victim to a botched robbery when he was shot and killed on his Albert Falls farm on April 18. However, new information has come to light which lead to the arrest of two family members. Moosa’s son was also shot on April 18 but he escaped with his life. Pietermaritzburg Crime Intelligence Detectives, along with the Mountain Rise Crime Prevention Unit, made the arrests over the weekend. During the arrest of the suspected hitmen, the detectives came under heavy fire, resulting in one suspect being shot dead while another was injured. Family spokesperson and cousin of the slain business owner, Mohammed Ebrahim Moosa, said their family is still in disbelief over the events that have transpired, especially the arrests of members of their own family. “This has been completely shocking and we hope that the law takes it course on those involved,” said Moosa, adding that the family were devastated by the news. Police confirmed the arrests and say that investigations are ongoing.
