When little Saybie was born, she weighed as much as a giant apple. “They told my husband he had about an hour with her and that she was going to pass away,” says the mother – who has chosen to remain anonymous – in a video released by the San Diego hospital where Saybie was born. “That hour turned into two hours, which turned into a day, which turned into a week.” And now five months later, this little miracle baby is finally on her way home after being released from the Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns in San Diego, California. According to Fox News, Saybie’s mother experienced severe pregnancy complications and was forced to give birth via emergency cesarean section at 23 weeks and three days. “A typical pregnancy lasts 40 weeks. Doctors said the preterm birth was necessary after they found that the baby was not gaining weight and her mother’s life was at immediate risk,” hospital officials said in a statement. “I kept telling them, 'She's not going to survive. She's – I'm only 23 weeks [pregnant]',” her mother says. “It was the scariest day of my life.”  Little Saybie, named by her medical team, was born in December 2018. She weighed just 245g, reports Daily Mail. After being stabilised by the life support team, Saybie was immediately transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit.  She didn’t have any of the medical issues typically associated with babies born before 28 weeks’ gestation, like lung and heart issues or brain bleeds, but staff feared she wouldn’t survive. But she did. After five months in hospital – and weighing a healthy 2,54kg – Saybie was discharged. She now weighs as much as a small bag of rice. Data from the Tiniest Babies Registry shows the Saybie is the world’s smallest surviving newborn. A girl from Germany, born in 2015, who weighed 252g, previously held the record. It’s clear Saybie is not only a little fighter, she’s a record-breaker too! Sources: Fox News, Daily Mail, CNN
