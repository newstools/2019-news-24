"We would like to reiterate our faith in the justice system and hope that this matter will be treated with [the] respect and integrity it deserves. We are a strong believer in the rule of law and the principles of natural justice. However, we know that the court of public opinion doesn’t subscribe to these principles. We therefore urge everyone to respect the court as the only competent body to pronounce on its outcomes." Ntuli said the party was alive to the political and public implications of charges against the two high profile party leaders, adding that the region was hoping for a speedy resolution to the matter.
