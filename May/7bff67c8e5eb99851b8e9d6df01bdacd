A 27-year-old woman appeared at the Mitchell’s Plain Magistrate’s Court last Thursday for the possession of stolen property worth around R80 000, Captain Ian Williams told  People’s Post. Mitchell’s Plain police received a complaint about a business at the corner of Bravo Street in Beacon Valley that was robbed last week Tuesday. Police responded to the complaint and found that the back door had been forcefully opened. Goods that were stolen included 20 batteries worth R2500, 10 trolley jacks worth R4000, engine oil to the value of R20 000. They also found spray paint and consumables worth R10 000. Police launched a follow-up investigation on Monday 6 May and it led them to a house in Polo Street, Beacon Valley where they were able to recover some of the stolen items: a motor bike, a pump, car mats, a battery, three Ryobi handline cordless drills, a sander, five radios and three radio faces. They arrested the suspect. Some of the goods that were recovered have since been returned to the store.
