Sixteen people were killed in separate accidents around Limpopo over the weekend, the transport and community safety department in the province has said. Two major accidents that claimed the lives of 10 people were due to alleged reckless driving, provincial transportÂ spokesperson Matome Moremi-Taueatsoala said. "In the first major accident, that happened on the R71 near Mageng village, an Isuzu Ldv was overtaking another motor vehicle when it collided head on with an oncoming Ford Ldv. In this accident four passengers died," he said. Another crash happened in the early hours of Sunday at Chuenespoort when a Renault sedan lost control on a curve and collided head-on with a VW Polo. Six people were killed in the crash, Moremi-Taueatsoala said. Provincial MEC for Transport and Community Safety Namane Dickson Masemola extends heartfelt condolences to the families of the sixteen victims killed in the crashes. "As we convey our deepest condolences and wish a speedy recovery to those who are injured, we continue to insist that motorists drive carefully. Reckless overtaking, fatigue and speeding have been proven to be one of the major causes of road fatalities," Masemola said. He appealed to road users to exercise patience towards one another, obey the rules of the road and not speed.
