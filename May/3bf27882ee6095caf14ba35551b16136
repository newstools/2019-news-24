Gunmen killed a priest and five worshippers during mass on Sunday in an attack on a Catholic church in northern Burkina Faso. The attackers - numbering between 20 and 30 - managed to trap some of the people inside then set fire to the church in the town of Dablo,Â about 200km from the capital Ouagadougou.   "They killed five of them. The priest, who was celebrating mass, was also killed, bringing the number of dead to six. Urbain Kabore, a government spokesman for the West African country's Sahel region, said the gunmen also destroyed all places serving alcohol. Zongo said there was "an atmosphere of panic in the town". "People are holed up in their homes, nothing is going on. The shops and stores are closed. It's practically a ghost town," he said.   The operation was ordered to free French hostages Patrick Picque and Laurent Lassimouillas who disappeared while on holiday in the remote Pendjari National Park in Benin on May 1. The team also found two female captives, an American woman and a South Korean.  Burkina Faso has suffered from increasingly frequent and deadly attacks attributed to a number of armed groups - including the Ansarul Islam group, the Group to Support Islam and Muslims (GSIM), and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, ISIS) in the Greater Sahara. Nearly 400 people have been killed since 2015 - mainly in hit-and-run raids, according to an AFP news agency tally. Armed groups target both Muslim and Christian clerics, mainly in the north. Former colonial ruler France has deployed some 4,500 troops in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad in a mission codenamed Barkhane to help local forces try to flush out armed groups.
