With the risk of being sick as a result of the drizzling weather voters turned up to cast their votes. Young and old voters came in their numbers to cast their votes during the sixth national general election that took place on Wednesday 8 May. A quick runaround Lwandle, Nomzamo and Asanda Village City, the City Vision team found enthusiastic voters eager to vote. Speaking to them made it clear to City Vision how important one’s “x” in the ballot box is, and what it means. “This day brings residents together to come out and vote,” said Zoyisile Peteni , who cast his vote at Nomalizo Creche, Nomzamo. “It is important, as it gives you a voice, a platform to express your views, and have them heard. “It is essential that the community’s voice is heard. When you make that vote, you have the power to change your community and the country as a whole. The day is more important than other days, in my view.” Peteni believes people should exercise this right, one that was “unheard of” in the past.
