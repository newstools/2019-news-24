Saray Khumalo, a business executive, made history when she reached the summit in the early hours of Thursday, May 16. It was her fourth attempt to summit the mountain. It hasn't been an easy trip for Khumalo. An Irish professor - who was part of the party that summited with Khumalo - slipped on the way down on the Friday, News24 reported. Seamus Lawless, 39, was part of an eight-member expedition and was one of three Irish climbers to reach the summit, Newstalk reported.

The death toll for this season for the climb is 10, Al Jazeera reported on Saturday.
