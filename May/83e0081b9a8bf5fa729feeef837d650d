Police have arrested a quad bike rider for assaulting an elderly man in Port Elizabeth on Friday. The 67-year-old man is said to have confronted the biker for driving recklessly on Sedan Street in Lorraine. The biker, 26, is seen on video, captured by another motorist, repeatedly beating and dragging the man. "The man was severely assaulted and, at about 18:45, he went to Walmer police to report the incident. However, due to the nature of his injuries, he needed immediate medical attention," police spokesperson Sandra Janse van Rensburg said. Police then opened a case on his behalf. The biker was arrested at his home on Monday morning on a charge of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He is set to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court later in the day.
