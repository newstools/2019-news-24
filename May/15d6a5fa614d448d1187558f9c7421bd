Police are urging the victim or victims of an armed robbery that happened on Monday in the south of Johannesburg to come forward. "We saw the video circulating on social media, but a complaint [with the police] hasn't been filed," Johannesburg police spokesperson Constable Moloko Kgatla told News24. The video in question shows a group of armed men approaching a white vehicle on the Xavier Street onramp to the N12. After a short scuffle between the armed men and the occupants of the vehicle, the assailants drive off in a silver car. Kgatla said the incident happened in the Booysens policing area. He said police stations in and round the area hadn't received an incident report.
