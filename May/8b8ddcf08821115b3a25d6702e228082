Alan Winde has been elected Western Cape premier, while Sihle Zikalala has been elected KwaZulu-Natal premier as provincial legislatures around the country sit for the first time on Wednesday. DA premier candidate Winde was elected Western Cape premier in the provincial legislature, after newly sworn-in MPLs voted on Wednesday. The ANC put forward their leader in the legislature, Cameron Dugmore, as a nominee for premier. Winde received 24 votes, while Dugmore received 10. There were six spoiled votes. In a speech afterwords, Winde struck a reconciliatory tone. "I welcome Cameron Dugmore, the leader of the opposition, and leaders of other parties here and I also hope that, in this process, it's not only about the legislative process in the House, but that we also talk about those issues that we all saw when we were out campaigning in the last few months."  Elsewhere in the country, Sihle Zikalala was elected KwaZulu-Natal premier after he was nominated unopposed in the provincial legislature. Zikalala's nomination was accepted and confirmed by KwaZulu-Natal Judge President Achmat Jappie. Zikalala and other MPLs took their oaths of affirmations in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday. "Congratulations Mr Sihle Zikalala," the official provincial government Twitter account tweeted on Wednesday.  ANC Eastern Cape chairperson Oscar Mabuyane has also been elected premier in the Eastern Cape.  Sefora "Sisi" Ntombela was officially elected Premier of the Free State, while Job Mokgoro was elected Premier of the North West.  The other four provinces are also sitting to swear in new MPLs, and elect provincial speakers and premiers on Wednesday. This story will be updated as new premiers are elected around the country.
