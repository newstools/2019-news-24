At least 17 injured as tourist bus hit by bomb near Egypt's Giza Pyramids A roadside bomb has hit a tourist bus near the Giza Pyramids, Egyptian officials said.
The blast on Sunday wounded at least 17 people, including tourists, officials confirmed. The three wounded South African tourists would remain in hospital, South African ambassador to Egypt, Vusi Mavimbela said on Sunday. Pictures on social media showed at least one person covered in blood and a bus with some of its windows blown out or shattered. The bomb went off on a road near the Grand Egyptian Museum, which is still under construction and not open to tourists. Sunday's blast came as Egypt's vital tourism industry showed signs of recovery after years in the doldrums because of the political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising that toppled former leader Hosni Mubarak, AFP reported. Dirco spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya said that the Dirco Consular Services were in touch with all stakeholders and families. "The Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Lindiwe Sisulu, wishes those admitted to hospital a speedy recovery and has also directed South Africa's ambassador to Egypt to give them all the necessary support," Mabaya said.
