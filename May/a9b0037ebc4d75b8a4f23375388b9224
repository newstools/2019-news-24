Police in the North West have arrested six people for allegedly torching an electoral officer's vehicle in Ganyesa on Monday - the day that special votes opened. "The incident has something to do with disruptions of voting processes and as a result, the vehicle ended up being torched," provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Sabataa Mokgwabone said. Mokgwabone said the vehicle was not completely burnt and that police were investigating the incident. He added that disgruntled protesters in Ikageng also burnt an empty ballot box.
