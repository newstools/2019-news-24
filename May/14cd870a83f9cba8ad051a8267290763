The EFF is inspired by its growth as ballot counting wraps up and so far, it has bagged more than 1.2 million votes nationally. Visiting the Electoral Commission of SA's (IEC) results operations centre in Tshwane, Gauteng on Thursday evening, EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu told journalists that the party was the only one which showed significant growth. "We are happy with the performance of the EFF," he said, adding that the party's growth was inspiring. "We are the only party that has significantly grown in terms of actual numbers. This shows the confidence that the people of South Africa have in the EFF."
