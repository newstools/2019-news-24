A critically-injured woman was left lying helpless on the road after she was allegedly hit by a truck which then fled the scene in the Free State. The woman was found by ER24 paramedicsÂ on the N8 near Petrusburg, 70km outside Bloemfontein, at about 19:00 on Saturday and rushed to hospital. ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said the paramedics came across the incident as they were making their way back to Bloemfontein. "They found the woman lying in the road with critical injuries. She sustained multiple fractures and serious lacerations," Vermaak said. "Paramedics stabilised her on scene and rushed her to Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein for further medical care. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident is not yet clear." In another accident, emergency and medical personnel had to use the jaws of life to rescue a 29-year-old man who had been trapped inside the wreckage of his vehicle on Springbok Road in Meyerton, south of Johannesburg. This was after his car had crashed into a tree. "Shortly after 7 am, paramedics from ER24 and Midvaal fire department arrived on the scene where they found the man still trapped inside of the vehicle. The Midvaal Fire Department had to use rescue tools to free him from the wreckage," said Vermaak. "Upon assessment, paramedics found that he had sustained critical injuries and was placed on life support. He was later rushed to Sebokeng Hospital for further care."
