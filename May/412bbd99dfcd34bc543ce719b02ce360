READ: More arrests for OR Tambo airport 'follow home' robberies "Their reign of terror came to an end when, on July 14, 2017, members of the National Investigation Unit and the Gauteng Provincial Investigation Unit, during an operation to combat airport-following robberies, spotted these four men in a sedan on the R21 highway in the vicinity of the airport," Naidoo said. "In trying to stop the suspects, a shootout ensued between the police and suspects. The suspects were eventually cornered and arrested." Initially arrested for unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition - after officers recovered a Z88 pistol, a .45 Calibre pistol, a .38 Special revolver and several rounds of ammunition - follow-up investigations were conducted and the suspects were also linked to armed robbery cases in Kempton Park, Olifantsfontein and Yeoville.
