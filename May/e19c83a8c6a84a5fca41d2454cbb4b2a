Two Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officers, Evelyn Mothibe and Nomphumelelo Nhlapo, were patrolling in Hillbrow on election day when they found a baby dumped in a black plastic bag. During their morning rounds the duo were approached by two men who said they could hear a baby crying on a street corner not too far from where they were, JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar tells DRUM. “The baby was found, without clothes, in a black bag on the corner of Twist and Wolmarans streets in Hillbrow.” Upon arriving on the scene, officers Mothibe and Nhlapo alerted emergency services while keeping the baby boy warm. “The baby was rushed to Charlotte Maxeke Hospital where he is now recovering,” Minnaar adds. Despite severe weather conditions at the time, the infant is in good health and recovering. A case has been opened at the Hillbrow Police Station and police officials are still looking for the mother. Minnaar advises anyone who can assist with information to dial 011-375-5911. The Chief of JMPD David Tembe has commended the officers for serving and protecting the community on Election Day.
