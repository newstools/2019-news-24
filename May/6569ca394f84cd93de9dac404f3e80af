It might be time for husbands to learn there's no outsmarting your wife. One mischievous dad tried fooling his wife into thinking he was in bed when he was in fact enjoying drinks in the local pub with his friends. According to Lad Bible Damien Keegan (42), from Dublin in Ireland, had been out with mates while his wife Fiona was away in Spain. When she checked in on him around 21:00; he lied and said he was on his way home. Unconvinced, she asked their daughter, Naomi, to send her pictures as proof. So Damien, a till manufacturer, left his buds in the pub and rushed home to take a picture before hurrying back to the tavern. His plan could have worked but then Naomi shared the pictures on Twitter – and the post went viral. "S*** my ma asked is Da in bed and he's acc in the pub but she's on holiday and doesn't know [sic]," she tweeted. "She asked me to take a pic of him in bed and he's getting a taxi home to get a pic in the bed and then going back out. The things you've to do to go the pub when ur wife's away… stinger da ye got caught after all (sic)."   Her hilarious tweet got more than 3 600 "likes" and nearly 400 retweets. The post was eventually spotted by Damien’s sister-in-law, who blew his cover, writes The Sun. "It had gone viral all over the internet and even got shared in Australia,” Damien said. "The whole of Dublin was talking about it. My wife was going mad, but you don't stop when you start drinking." His wife might not have been impressed but his taxi driver certainly was. After Damien told him of his plan, the driver laughed and gave him a free ride. SOURCES: The Mirror, The Sun, d Bible
