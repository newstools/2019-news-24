Kwaito star Mandla “Mampintsha” Maphumulo has dropped his assault charges against Bongekile “Babes Wodumo” Simelane. Mampinstha laid a counter-charge of assault against Babes Wodumo after she laid an assault charge against him following an altercation, which Babes recorded on her Instagram live in March 2019. His manager Lindo Buthelezi confirmed to Move! that his client decided to withdraw the case after the pair reconciled. “Yes, it’s true,” said Lindo. “They’ve reconciled and are back together and he has dropped the assault charges.” Lindo didn’t have much time to talk and asked that we call him later as he was preparing to accompany his client to his court appearance as Babes Wodumo has not yet dropped her charges against him. Lindo also revealed that Mampintsha was “anxious” because “he doesn’t know what to expect”. Mampintsha is appearing before the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court today on charges of assault. He is out on a R2 000 bail. It is still unknown if Babes will withdraw her charges against him. But she has featured on his music video called Khona Ingane Lay’Ndlini. Babes Wodumo is also currently appearing at Durban Magistrate’s court on charges of common assault after she allegedly hit a woman along with her sister and manager Nondumiso Simelane and fellow artist Tipcee (real name Thobeka Ndaba).
