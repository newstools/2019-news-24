The Hawks' Serious Corruption Investigation team on Thursday arrested a 45-year-old Seshego district court prosecutor for alleged corruption, extortion and defeating the ends of justice. The prosecutor allegedly demanded a R1 500 bribe from a complainant who was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in order to withdraw his case. "The complainant reported the matter to the Hawks who swiftly conducted an undercover operation that culminated in the arrest of the suspect in her office soon after accepting a bribe," the Hawks said in a statement. The Hawks' preliminary investigations reveal that the case of driving under the influence of liquor against the complainant was indeed withdrawn. The suspect will appear at the Seshego Magistrate's Court on Friday.  KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter
