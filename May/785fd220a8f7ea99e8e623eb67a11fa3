Foundation phase learners from Kukhanyile Primary School, in Khayelitsha, and KuyaKhanya Primary School, in Crossroads, took part in the Global Road Safety Week last week. The safety week, organised by non governmental organisation ChildSafe, kicked off last Monday and ended on Sunday. As part of the initiative a group of learners from Kukhanyile took part in a silent protest outside the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital to raise awareness around some dangers faced by children on the road and the need to protect them whether they are on sidewalks, walking on roads or riding in cars. Nolubabalo Mdoda-Gubevu, deputy principal for the foundation phase at Kukhanyile, said it was significant that the event was held at the hospital because not all children go to the hospital because they are sick. “There are a lot of children that go to the hospital because they have been involved in car accidents so it was fitting for the event to be held there,” she said. Mdoda-Gubevu said it was especially good for the learners because they learnt a lot about keeping themselves safe and to pass on the knowledge they got to their peers. She said the learners were very excited to be part of the event and had promised to share the knowledge with their families Executive director for Childsafe Yolande Baker said many injuries and deaths that occur on the roads could have been prevented. She said she applauds the organisations that are showing leadership in the field of road safety. Baker added that young children have a voice too and that the protest is a powerful way to remind decision makers that they bear a profound responsibility in keeping children safe as road users.
