A man caught in possession of 13 042 dried and shucked abalone is expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Monday, Western Cape police said. Table View crime prevention unit officers conducting patrols in Malibongwe Drive spotted the man skipping a red traffic light on Friday, police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said in a statement. "The SAPS (SA Police Service) members pulled up next to the vehicle and saw boxes wrapped in plastic [inside]. The driver was requested to stop the vehicle and to answer on the contents of the sealed boxes," he said. "When he could not account for its contents, the members checked the 35 boxes and found it filled with a total of 13 042 shucked dried abalone. The estimated street value of the abalone must still be determined."
