I have an appointment to speak with Ms Ndamase at 12:30 this afternoon and we'll then put out a comprehensive statement on the whole process," Kirby Gordon, FlySafair: Head of Sales and Distribution told News24 on Monday."What I can confirm is that Ms Ndamase and her travelling companions were deemed by the crew to be unruly and were escorted off the aircraft by [police] upon arrival at OR Tambo International," Gordon added.

It doesn't happen often. "We operate about 2 240 flights a month and we might have one incident every other month, maybe slightly more during the festive season."News24 reported in January that an unruly passenger was removed from a Kulula flight bound for Johannesburg.In that case, Kulula argued that it would not allow its crew to be "verbally or physically abused". Personal spaceAccording to a study titled "Air Rage: What Factors Influence Airline Passenger Anger?" by Alexandra N Vredenburgh and Ilene B Zackowitz, confinement and a lack of personal space are contributing factors for passengers' anger on flights.According to a 2016 publication by the Australian government, "Trends and Issues in crime and criminal justice", unruly passengers pose "a number of risks of harm".The study advised that airline policy had a substantial effect on the management of unruly passengers and management strategies should include employee training, observation of passengers on the ground, responsible service of alcohol and identification and engagement with large groups of travellers, among others.
