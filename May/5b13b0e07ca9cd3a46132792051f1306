Gqom artist Babes Wodumo (real name Bongekile Simelani), her sister Nondumiso Simelane and fellow artist Tipcee’s (real name Thobeka Ndaba) pre-trail for common assault was postponed after they appeared briefly at the Durban Magistrate’s court on Wednesday morning. The case was postponed after the prosecutor said there was a confusion with the court dates and Magistrate Jackie Jonck agreed and rescheduled the pre-trail for 30 May 2019.

Outside the court Babes and her co-accused, Tipcee and Nondumiso refused to give comment on the case.  The trio are appearing for a charge of common assault, which was laid by KwaZulu-Natal businesswoman Nelisiwe Zondi in March. Nelisiwe arrived at the court with body guards. Speaking to Drum, she alleged that Babes and her co-accused beat her on the same night that Babes’ recorded herself being assaulted by kwaito artist Mampintsha. She claimed that she was ambushed at a party in Glenwood, Durban by the trio who accused her of working for Mampinstha after she tried to record them with her cellphone. “I thought I was dying. They took turns stomping on me with their feet. I was traumatised and I screamed for help, but they didn’t stop. I believe the neighbours called the police because there was so much noise and screaming coming from the guesthouse,” she said of the incident.
