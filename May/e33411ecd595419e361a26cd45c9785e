The SABC's Radio Park building in Auckland Park, Johannesburg, was evacuated on Wednesday morning at around 10:45 following a diesel leak. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst has told News24 that, according to information he had received from the scene, 2 000 litres of diesel had leaked from a generator on the 15th floor. "Many people have been evacuated, but others are still trapped on the 17th floor. Our paramedics can't get to them and they can't come down because of the fumes. We are waiting for the fire department to assist." The Johannesburg fire department was on the scene, as well as other emergency service providers. Herbst said no fires had been reported. Difficulty breathing On social media, employees reported that some people had collapsed and had difficulty breathing. Herbst said in a subsequent statement that three patients suffered the effects of chemical inhalation and were treated on scene before being transported by ambulance to hospital for further assessment. When News24 arrived on the scene, most of the evacuated personnel had been sent home. Others were still loitering around the building as they had left their keys in their offices.
