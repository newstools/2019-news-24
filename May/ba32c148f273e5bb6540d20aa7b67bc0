Thieves got away with over R150 000 after breaking in at a Khayelitsha Post Office last week Thursday. The post office is situated at Mkhabeni Road in Khayelitsha. Lingelethu West police spokesperson Sergeant Xoliswa Nyalambisa said there was a business break-in at the Khayelitsha Post Office on 2 May 2019. She said police visited the crime scene and viewed video footage of the break-in, although the quality was poor. “The entrance was gained through the back door, two suspects walked in and opened safe doors,” said Nyalambisa. She said no damage was seen and the suspects fled with an amount of about R158 000. The case is still under investigation and no one has been arrested. Post Office spokesperson for the Western Cape Martie Gilchrist said the break-in happened during the night and therefore there was no trauma inflicted on the staff and clients at the Post Office. “Following the police investigation, the office had to be closed and we apologise to our clients for the inconvenience but it was opened the next day,” she said. Gilchrist said it is unfortunate that something like this had to happen.
