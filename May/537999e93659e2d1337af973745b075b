An employee of the fire department in Humansdorp was arrested in the early hours of Saturday morning with diesel suspected to have been stolen from fire trucks, Eastern Cape police said. Patrolling police officers noticed a vehicle on the side of the road in Bosbok Street just after midnight and questioned the driver, who said he worked at the local fire department and had a flat tyre, said Captain Gerda Swart. Officers decided to search the Hyundai SUV and found the man, 40, had eight 25 litre plastic containers inside. "The suspect could not give a sound reason for being in possession of the diesel containers, especially at that time of the night. Members also recalled that various cases of theft out of motor vehicle were reported where diesel was stolen from the trucks at the Fire Department," said Swart. He was arrested on a charge of possession of suspected stolen goods. The estimated value of the diesel is R3 300. He is expected to appear in the Humansdorp Magistrate's Court on Monday. Swart said they were looking at the possibility of linking the man to other cases. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24Â on Twitter
