Cape Town
resident Chris Smith is still in shock after learning his daughter and her
boyfriend died in a car accident last weekend. Carly Smith
and Marck Lockett were English teachers in Vietnam, but Chris is still unsure
exactly how the accident happened. “We still
have so many questions. We don’t know who’s responsible for the accident or if
they died on impact. It’s difficult for our family to talk about it at this
stage because we don’t really know what happened,” Chris says. The Smiths
aren’t even sure when the bodies of the two teachers will be returned home. Carly was a
paramedic before she decided to go overseas to teach English with Marck. Her
death has sent shockwaves through the paramedic community and messages of
condolences have been pouring in from all over the country. Emergency
services in Australia have also shared their condolences as the young paramedic
had been a mentor to Aussie students who’d come to SA for training. “We woke up
this morning to hear the sad news of Carly’s death. She was a respected
paramedic from South Africa. She was a wonderful mentor to our students, a
beautiful person inside and out and she always lived life to the full,” EMS
Australia wrote on its Facebook page. Chris didn’t
want to comment any further but said the family are waiting on more details
surrounding the circumstances of their daughter’s death.
