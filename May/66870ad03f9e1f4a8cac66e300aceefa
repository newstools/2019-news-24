Five alleged members of a "battery gang" have been arrested for stealing tower back-up batteries in Johannesburg. According to police spokesperson, Captain Mavela Masondo, the five people, aged 20 to 43, were traced to a house in Rosettenville. The South African Police Service (SAPS), Bidvest Coin Security, the Ekurhuleni Tactical Task Team and local security companies followed the gang from Vodacom, MTN and Telkom towers. Upon searching the premises, police found 65 batteries which have a total combined value of R900 000. Police have recovered back up batteries to the value of R900 000.

"Police regard this arrest as a breakthrough given the recent increase in the number of network towers being broken into and back-up batteries being stolen in Gauteng," Masondo said. They will be charged with the possession of stolen property, theft and tampering with essential infrastructure. They are expected to appear in the Booysens Magistrate's Court soon. Suspected members of the battery gang are arrested. (Photo: Supplied) KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24Â on Twitter
