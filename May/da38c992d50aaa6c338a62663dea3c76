A TEAM of delegates from the Kwa­Zulu-Natal Agricultural Union Kwanalu met with King Goodwill Zwelithini to discuss the vital role organised agriculture plays in the future of an all-inclusive, productive and united sector in the province. President of Kwanalu Andy Buchan, together with CEO Sandy La Marque and vice-presidents Phenias Gumede and Peter-John Hassard, met with His Majesty King Zwelithini and Prince Thulani Zulu in Durban to discuss solution-orientated initiatives for agrarian reform and rural development, sustained economic growth and agricultural challenges in KZN. “His Majesty endorsed Kwanalu’s proactive approach to agrarian reform and rural development; we received a strong message of support from his Majesty, with him urging us to continue to lobby for agriculture in the province,” said La Marque of the meeting. Issues discussed included safety and security and, in particular, farm attacks and murders, stock theft, labour issues, CSI initiatives, and natural resources. Land reform and rural development areas debated included sustainable solution-orientated initiatives, infrastructure, training, mentorship, economic growth, rural development, and social integration. “This was a highly productive and positive meeting in which we received his Majesty’s encouragement for Kwanalu to continue to lobby for farmers in the province, using our present basket of opportunities and models currently in practice in the province. “Training and education, water shortage, import controls, community-orientated partnerships, the protection of natural resources and building a culture of ‘work’ were areas of focus and goals we set ourselves,” said La Marque. — Supplied.
