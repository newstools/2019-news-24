A special prayer service will be held at KwaNomzamo on Thursday May, 2 ahead of the national and provincial elections next week. Kouga Executive Mayor Horatio Hendricks said all political parties and community members were invited to the session, set to take place from 17:00 18:30pm at the St Patrick’s Anglican Church in Zakhe Street. “The aim is for representatives from all political parties and community members to join us in praying for a peaceful election,” he said. “The signing of a peace agreement by all parties will also form part of the programme.” The session is a joint initiative by Kouga Municipality and the Parish of the Good Shepherd of the Anglican Church. Hendricks further encouraged all residents to cast their votes next week. There will be 40 voting stations across Kouga wards, including the Patensie Correctional Centre. Special voting will take place on May 6 and 7. It is open to those whose application for special voting was approved by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). “There are two categories of people who were invited to apply for special votes - those who are physically unable to leave their houses, including heavily pregnant women, and people with disabilities, and those who are unable to visit their voting stations on May 8,” Hendricks explained. He said IEC officials would visit the houses of those who fall in the first category on May 6 and 7 so that they may cast their votes. Those voters who fall in the second category will be able to vote at their local IEC voting stations, also on May 6 and 7. The official voting day will follow on May 8.
