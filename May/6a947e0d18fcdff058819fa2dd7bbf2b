The Department of Police, Roads and Transport in the Free State advises vehicle owners in the greater Thaba Nchu to make use of testing stations at nearby towns. This followed temporary closure of the Thaba Nchu station due to maintenance to improve service delivery. Hillary Mophethe, spokesperson of the department, said the station is expected to re-open on 7 June for service. The contractor is reportedly on site to handle issues at hand. A similar maintenance programme was completed at the Lengau Testing Centre in Bloemfontein, which began operating on Tuesday (28/05). Mophethe said the department has arranged transport to assist residents of Thaba Nchu visiting testing stations in Botshabelo, Ladybrand and Bloemfontein. Vehicle owners in Thaba Nchu are requested to gather at the townâ€™s traffic testing station to be assisted with transport going to the testing stations in the three towns mentioned. Departure time of transport is daily at 09:00.
