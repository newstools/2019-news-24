The Western Cape ANC's provincial executive committee (PEC) has overturned its provincial working committee's (PWC) decision to suspend treasurer Maurencia Gillion over a controversial election donation from businessman Iqbal Survé. The decision was taken at a meeting on Friday night. "She remains in her position. We have agreed to return a donation received last week," ANC Western Cape secretary Faiez Jacobs said in a statement on Friday. Gillion was suspended on Wednesday after it was discovered that she failed to return the donation received from Survé's Sekunjalo group, News24 earlier reported.

He further stated that he wanted "nothing in return". Among others, this meeting also served to determine the ANC's representatives in the Western Cape legislature as well as who would represent the party in the National Council of Province (NCOP). At the gathering, a decision was also taken to investigate a parody twitter account that harasses ANC members.
