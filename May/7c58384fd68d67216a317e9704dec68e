KwaZulu-Natal police say calm has been restored to the Durban container terminal, where protesting truck drivers blockaded roads overnight, causing traffic congestion on Wednesday morning. Various social media users shared pictures of the blockade, advising motorists to avoid Bayhead and Langeberg roads.   According to KZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele, no damage to property or injuries were reported from the scene of the protest. "About 50 truck drivers blockaded Bayhead Road harbour," said Mbele. "The situation is under control and [police] members are monitoring the area," she said. According to IOL, truck owners who transport shipping containers to and from the Durban container terminal are demanding a meeting with Transnet. They claim that officials from Transnet only gave them empty promises over the years.   At the same time, KZN police are closely monitoring protest action in the Pietermaritzburg CBD. According to Mbele, community members embarked on protest action at around 06:00 on Wednesday. "The situation is currently calm as members of the Public Order Police and SA Police Service are monitoring the area," said Mbele.
