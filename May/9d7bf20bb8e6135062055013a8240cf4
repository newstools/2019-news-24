"We're a registered zoological facility so he was accompanied at all times and had all the necessary permits. "We started the whole process of transporting him to the hospital at 10:30 and returned back home at 13:15," Heynis said. Chaos was treated by a team of five radiation therapists, as well as one radiation oncologist. "There were no other human patients around while he was treated and he came into the hospital through a back door," Radiation Specialist, Hanri Reynolds told News 24 on Tuesday.
