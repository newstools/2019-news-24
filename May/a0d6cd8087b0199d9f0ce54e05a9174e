A 53-year-old woman from Valencia in
Spain, who left her dead sister on the kitchen floor for 20 days, told cops she
didn’t believe her sibling was dead despite neighbours complaining about the
stench. The woman, whose name hasn’t been
revealed, lived with her 50-year-old sister in the city. She told police her
sister had fallen but that she couldn’t lift her so instead she dressed her in
a nappy and put a pillow under her head. According to local media reports,
authorities were alerted to the incident after the sisters’ neighbours noticed
a strong smell coming from their flat. The body is said to have been in a
clear state of decomposition and an autopsy showed she’d died of natural
causes, with her body showing no signs of violence. The elder sister reportedly failed to
give a coherent statement to the police initially so she was taken to the local
Sant Joan hospital to undergo a psychiatric test. The
psychiatric test revealed she was suffering from “hysterical amnesia” and was
later released. A neighbour told reporters that
charities had tried to help the sisters – who lived alone – but that they
refused to let social workers into their home. According to reports, a relative
travelled from the Spanish capital, Madrid, to take care of the elder sister. In 1991, just 100m from the sisters’
flat, the body of a mummified man was found in his home. The man had died 17 years earlier
when he was 67 years old and nobody had been to his flat in all that time. The body was found when police broke
into the house in order to investigate a burglary and he was found to have died
from a heart attack. Sources: Magazine Features Pictures: CENTRALEUROPEANNEWS/WWW.MAGAZINEFEATURES.CO.ZA
