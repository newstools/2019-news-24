The City of Tshwane has suspended A Re Yeng Bus Rapid Transport and A Re Yeng Mamelodi Bus operations following wage disputes, the municipality revealed on Monday. As a result, the member of the mayoral committee for roads and transport, Sheila Senkubuge, has encouraged passengers to make alternative transport arrangements ahead of the suspension. "All A Re Yeng Mamelodi Bus operations will remain suspended until further notice. We urge passengers to exercise patience during this period as the suspension is a move to ensure their safety and to safeguard the City's assets. We also encourage passengers to make alternative transport arrangements," Senkubuge said. This after a wage dispute between Tshwane Rapid Transport Pty Ltd (TRT) and Mamelodi Bus drivers. The dispute is in connection with the salary disparity between Mamelodi Bus drivers and their A Re Yeng Bus counterparts. The City issued a notice on Sunday urging residents to exercise patience as A Re Yeng Bus operations are set to be suspended ahead of a looming strike on Monday.
