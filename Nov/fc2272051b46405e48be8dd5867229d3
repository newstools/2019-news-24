Gauteng police are investigating a case of business burglary following a break-in at a Tembisa primary school in the early hours of Thursday morning. CCTV footage shared on Twitter by Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi shows a number of people searching a classroom at Khulasizwe Primary School for items. According to Gauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters, various items – computers, laptops, two servers and an undisclosed amount of money – were taken. She added that more items could be reported stolen, as police were still on the scene investigating. Lesufi later tweeted that a suspect involved in the robbery had been apprehended by police, but Peters denied this. "No suspect(s) have been arrested and police are appealing to anyone with information to report it to Tembisa Police," she said. Lesufi also expressed much concern over the safety of schools, calling them "hunting grounds" for criminals. "We can't postpone the future of our children," he said after calling for action from the police.
