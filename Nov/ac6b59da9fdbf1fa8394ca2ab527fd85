The Nelson Mandela Bay council will sit again on Monday for a Special Council Meeting to discuss a motion of no confidence in executive mayor Mongameli Bobani. Last month, council speaker Buyelwa Mafaya abruptly cancelled the special sitting at the 11th hour in an early morning communication, citing "safety concerns", News24 reported. This after it was largely mooted that Bobani would finally see the axe fall on his tenure following a change in the numbers in the council for the ANC - one of the governing coalition partners.

Trollip, while stepping away from all party positions, is still a DA member and seemingly still holds his position in council. It remains to be seen if this will continue following his resignation from party leadership. DA provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga is also attending the council meeting. The sitting began on Monday with a moment of silence for ANC councillor Mzuvukile Boti, who died in October.
