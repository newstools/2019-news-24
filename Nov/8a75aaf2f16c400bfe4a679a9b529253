The Hawks have arrested a senior employee of the Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs’ (Cogta) Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent (MISA). News24 understands that it is the CEO of Cogta MISA, Goodman Ntandazo Vimba. The arrest, which was made on Thursday morning, was confirmed by Cogta spokesperson Lungi Mtshali. The Hawks would not confirm Vimba's name but said that ten had been arrested across the country in connection the Amathole municipality toilet corruption case. It is unclear what charges Vimba is facing. The Hawks are in full flight, with the arrest of former minister of state security Bongani Bongo on Thursday morning. He was charged with corruption in the Western Cape Magistrate’s Court.
