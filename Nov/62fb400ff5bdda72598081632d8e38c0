 A couple has been rescued in Still Bay after getting caught in rip currents while swimming near the mouth of the Goukou River. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Still Bay duty crew was notified of two swimmers who appeared to be in difficulty at around 17:35 on Thursday. "Following a brief search at the river mouth, we found a couple – a 27-year-old male and 22-year-old female, from Jongensfontein – 250 metres off-shore of the river mouth, behind the backline," NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said in a statement on Saturday. The woman was assisting the man, who was unconscious, to stay afloat in the water. "They were rescued onto our sea rescue craft and brought safely into Still Bay harbour with our NSRI medics treating the couple for hypothermia and non-fatal drowning symptoms." The woman was treated for hypothermia while the man was stabilised and regained consciousness. He was taken to hospital and was discharged the next day.
