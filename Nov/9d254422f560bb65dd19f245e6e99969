Three men were arrested on Monday morning after allegedly robbing a well-known seafood restaurant in Kalk Bay, Cape Town, and shooting a traffic officer, authorities say. The officer had been driving on Main Road near the harbour when he saw the robbery unfolding at Kalky's restaurant. He was shot in the upper arm, said spokesperson Richard Coleman. Western Cape police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said four armed men fled the scene in a Hyundai Getz with an undisclosed amount of money. Law enforcement officers and Muizenberg police pursued the vehicle as it sped off along Baden Powell Drive. Rwexana said the three men, aged between 30 and 35, were arrested and a firearm was recovered. Scene 'still active' The getaway vehicle was found to have been reported hijacked in Muizenberg.
