The Kensington AFC girls’ team has excelled in its first year. The team was started at the beginning of the year, with most of the members being the first-time soccer players. It has 17 players between the ages of nine and 14. Head coach Nigel Bieding noticed their potential and registered them in the Tygerberg Football League where they scooped fifth place in the u.14 category and received a few individual awards. He says they received top goal scorer, player of the year and sport woman of the year awards from the league. Bieding says it took hard work and dedication to achieve these positive results. He says this has inspired them to introduce an u.16 team next year. “There is so much potential in our community. All that is needed is to create a platform for young girls to show off their talent,” Bieding says. He says the team was started when a few girls showed passion for the sport and played with boys. The coaches wanted to show them they are as important as the boys. “Their good performance was a bonus for us,” he says. Kawthar Martin (14) used to play with the boys before the team was started. She says it is exciting to play competitively with other girls and to watch her team mates develop. She says they are looking forward to the new season next year.
