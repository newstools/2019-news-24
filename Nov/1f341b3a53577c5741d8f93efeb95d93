LOCAL football club Maritzburg United brought tears of joy to 65-year-old Gladys Ndlovu of Impendle when they donated a wheelchair to her last Thursday. Ndlovu has been bedridden for more than two years after suffering a stroke and has not even been able to leave her rondavel as she had no wheelchair. Maritzburg United officials and players visited her home in the Nhlabamkhosi village after being alerted about Ndlovu’s situation by a local non-profit organisation, the Izandla Zothando Foundation. “I don’t have enough words to thank Izandla Zothando and Maritzburg United,” said a tearful Ndlovu, sitting on her mattress. “I can’t even remember the last time I got out of the house. I don’t even know how my yard looks anymore. So, I’m really grateful that I will finally be able to get out of the house. May God bless you all.” Ndlovu and other five needy families in the rural area that were identified by Izandla Zothando also received groceries from the club and Phoenix Cash and Carry. The foundation’s chairperson, Wonder Dlamini, profusely thanked United’s management for helping the community of Impendle. “As Izandla Zothando we would like to thank Maritzburg United and their chairman, Farook Kadodia, because this would not be possible without them. “We would also like to thank Phoenix and we hope these positive developments will help Mrs Ndlovu in her recovery as well,” said Dlamini. United official Prince Shabalala said on behalf of the club that it is always a great pleasure to help the people of Pietermaritzburg and surrounding areas. Players Nazier Allie, Phumlani Ntshangase, Bandile Shandu and Bongokuhle Hlongwane were all part of the wheelchair and groceries handover.
