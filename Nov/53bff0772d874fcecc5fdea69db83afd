A truck driver who lost control of his vehicle that crashed into the wall of a house in Reservoir Hills, KwaZulu-Natal, on Thursday has died, the authorities say. Six passengers who were also in the truck were stable, Rescue Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson told News24. According to Jamieson, the two passengers who were seated in front with the driver were trapped in the cab and the Jaws of Life was used to free them. The other four passengers were travelling on the back of the truck. The accident happened at about 17:30, said Jamieson. No one in the house was injured. Jamieson said while the weather in the province - with rescue workers and disaster management teams on high alert as thunderstorms loom - remained bad, "it is calm".   The truck driver died after the vehicle ploughed into a home in KZN.
