There
was complete chaos on Saturday when a man walked into Witbank hospital and shot
one of the patients. Ruben
Espach (20), who’d just had brain surgery, was in a ward directly above where
the shooting happened. “We
heard five or six shots,” says Chris, Ruben’s father. Ruben fell off his
friend’s dirt bike two weekends ago on their farm near Middelburg, Mpumalanga,
and suffered brain and head injuries. He hadn’t been wearing a helmet. Chris
says they’d just been to see Ruben and were on their way to the car when
Trudie, Ruben’s mom, realised they’d forgotten to leave Ruben the cooldrink
they’d bought. The couple turned around and went back to Ruben’s room. “That’s
when we heard the shots,” Chris says. It came from the level below. I ran down
the stairs, where a security guard told me to call the police.” Chris
first ran to his car to check that his two daughters, Juanita (27) and
Chrizanne (6), were safe before he made the call. “We
all got a huge fright. You think your child is safe in hospital where he’s
recovering, then something like this happens.” Police
spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi says a patient was admitted to the hospital
the previous Wednesday with gunshot wounds. “It looks as if the shooter came
back to finish his job.” There
was an altercation between the patient and the shooter, followed by the
gunshots. The patient died at the scene. Police are investigating the incident.
