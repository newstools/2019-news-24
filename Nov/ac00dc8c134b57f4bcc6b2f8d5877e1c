A late-night trip for this e-hailing taxi driver soon turned into a fight for survival when he was attacked by armed suspects in Durban on November 18. Dashcam footage of the incident shows three men sitting casually inside the vehicle. One of the occupants then suddenly puts the driver in a chokehold, while another produces a knife. The suspects then proceed to help themselves to valuables from the driver and look for more items to take. According to police spokespersonÂ Captain Nqobile Gwala, the incident took place at around 02:00 in Newlands East. "The complainant picked up two males and drove off and while driving on Musa Dladla Drive he was blocked by a white vehicle." Gwala said the two armed passengers and driver of the white vehicle robbed the taxi driver of his cash, cellphone and other valuable items. A case of robbery was opened at the Newlands East police station. No arrests have been made yet.
