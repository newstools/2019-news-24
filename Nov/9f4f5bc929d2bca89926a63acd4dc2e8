A 17-year-old girl tragically lost her life when she was
electrocuted while using hair tongs at home. Melanie Anaya, from San Rafael in western Argentina,
reportedly screamed during the incident and was rushed to hospital where she
was later declared dead. When police authorities confirmed that Melanie had died of
electrocution, the hair straightener was seized for further investigation. Martin Carrizo, a stylist from Hair Carrizo in Buenos
Aires, said that “hair straighteners are, in general, very safe”. However, he added: “What can happen is that sometimes the
wire starts to twist with the movement, and this can cause internal movement in
the cable which can generate a short circuit.” According to the stylist, straighteners should always be
well insulated and “never left without protection”. “We should care for
them very well,” he warned. Sources:
