WITH 16 Days of Activism against gender-based violence approaching, non-profit organisation — WeServ Christian Lyric Theatre and Shisanyama — recently hosted an event called Daddy Daughter Date (3D) at the Dominican House Chapel in Scottsville. Co-founder of the organisation Delana Rawlins said the concept was created because they felt that little girls needed to be taught how to be treated. And who best to teach them other than their fathers? “As the team at WeServ, we all had lumps in our throats as we witnessed the need daughters have for their fathers’ love and the need to be taught how to be treated,” said Rawlins. Fathers in Pietermaritzburg came out in their numbers, dressed up in formal wear to treat their daughters to their first dinner date. They were treated to a three-course meal and danced into the evening. At the 3D, every father opened the car door for his daughter before making an entrance on a red carpet into the venue. Rawlins emphasised that Pietermaritzburg has never hosted a Daddy Daughter Date before, adding that as the WeServ team, they applaud all the fathers who took the time to take their daughters on their first date. “With all the violence against women, all men have been painted with the same brush and it is good to see that some fathers are willing to fight the problem. Hopefully more fathers will come on board for our next event because the little girls had the time of their lives,” said Rawlins. WeServ is committed to the community as they have also recently hosted a Durban gospel group- Grace Enough, where congregants and community members enjoyed a night of music by the group and local artists who were given a platform to perform. “The evening was blessed and a huge success. We would like to thank everybody that came out and we urge the community to come out again this Friday, November 1,” said Rawlins.
