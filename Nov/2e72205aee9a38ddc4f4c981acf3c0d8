A group of young men dressed in what has become known as the signature Faf de Klerk Speedo managed to steal a bit of the Springboks' limelight as the Rugby World champions paraded the Webb Ellis Cup through the streets of Johannesburg on Thursday. The crew, dressed in Bean Bag The Brand Speedos made famous by De Klerk, welcomed the Springboks with a dance as they passed through FNB Bank City in the CBD. "We are here to support the Bokke as a local manufacturing company. As you know Faf [de Klerk] has given us the signature look so we decided this morning that we are going to return the favour by having all the boys dressed in the Speedo," Albert Louw told News24. Hundreds of South Africans lined Johannesburg's streets to celebrate the Springboks 32-12 win over England in the second leg of the Trophy Tour. FNB CEO Jacques Celliers was among the hundreds of supporters who praised the Boks, with captain Siya Kolisi taking a moment to thank him and FNB for supporting the team who returned from Japan on Tuesday. The pair also lifted the cup to resounding applause from the public. After making its way through the CBD, the Springboks' bus swiftly moved on to complete the Gauteng leg of the tour in Johannesburg's oldest township, Soweto.
