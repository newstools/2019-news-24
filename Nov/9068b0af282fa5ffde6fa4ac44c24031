The driver of the bakkie that crashed near Groblersdal in Limpopo on Tuesday - claiming the lives of five girls who hitched a ride home after writing exams - has been arrested for suspected drunken driving. News24 reported that the pupils - four in Grade 10 and one in Grade 9 and aged between 15 and 18 - died when the bakkie crashed along the R574 road between Groblersdal and Mpudulle at around 14:00. According to police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, the driver will face five counts of culpable homicide, in addition to drunken driving. Mojapelo said the driver of the Nissan NP200 bakkie apparently lost control of the vehicle when approaching Matrompi bridge and it rolled several times, instantly killing the five pupils and critically injuring the driver and his crew. The injured were taken to hospital. The driver and his crew were the only survivors of the crash. "The deceased, all girls, were allegedly hitchhiking next to the local filling station and were given a lift by the driver of the said vehicle. They were coming from school to their respective residences at Sephaku and Kgaphamadi villages," Mojapelo said. They have been identified as Beauty Motsweni and Pearl Rakgalakane from Sephaku; and Lucy Monareng, Chantel Monareng and Karabo Mogoaneng from Kgaphamadi.
