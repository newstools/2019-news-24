The firearm had reportedly been stolen in the robbery and was later recovered and returned to the couple. The couple, Cheryl Biggs and her husband Dave, confirmed to the newspaper that police had not kept the firearm as an exhibit pending the trial, because they needed it for protection. Instead, police collected the firearm from them on Monday. Biggs told the paper she had told the police that she did not know if it was loaded or not. According to a well-placed police source, the police officer who received the firearm should first have made sure it was not loaded, the newspaper reported. Police have not revealed details of the incident with police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker, saying "investigations are at a sensitive stage". National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Kholiswa Mdhuli said on Tuesday that they would not comment because the matter was still with the police. *This story has been updated.
