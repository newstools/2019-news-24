The KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg has dismissed former president Jacob Zuma's appeal against its decision not to stay his corruption prosecution. Zuma launched a leave to appeal bid, arguing the Supreme Court of Appeal could arrive at a different decision to the High Court. The High Court dismissed Zuma's leave to appeal application with costs. UPDATE:Â 'Not genuine' - Judges rule on Jacob Zuma's bid to avoid prosecution
