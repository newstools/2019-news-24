There are more delays in the case of a former Bryanston High School sports coach accused of sexually assaulting pupils. The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) is yet to decide on a review filed by the former coach, who cannot be named because he has not yet pleaded to sex crime charges. The case has been postponed over five times since first appearing in court. The 33-year-old appeared briefly in the Alexandra Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. The State said it was yet to receive a decision from the NDPP. Dressed in beige chino pants with a navy bomber jacket, the former coach sat in the gallery next to his partner, before making his way to the dock as proceedings started shortly after 09:00.

The matter was postponed to February 4, 2020, for a decision from the NDPP. The former coach's bail has been extended.
