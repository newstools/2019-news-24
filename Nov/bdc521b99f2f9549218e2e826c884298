Disaster management teams have had their hands full after several storms ripped through KwaZulu-Natal. This past weekend, teams started with mop-up operations after a severe thunderstorm left a trail of destruction in the northern part of the province. Strong winds and heavy rains have damaged 220 homes in the eMadlangeni local municipality and the Zululand district municipality. On Friday, another tornado hit Utrecht, while on Saturday a fourth tornado struck Ulundi, leaving a path of destruction as it tore through 45 homes. Tents, blankets, and basic supplies were being provided to the affected families. Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka warned residents to continue to be vigilant, as the South African Weather Service has indicated that severe thunderstorms are expected to continue in large parts of the province. "We are urging residents to protect themselves by taking heed to this important weather warning. We are also appealing to parents to ensure that pupils utilise the correct routes to get to school," HlomukaÂ said. As clean-up operations continued, the number of homes affected by the storm were expected to rise. No fatalities or injuries have been reported.
