About 500 youths are expected to fill the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) in the CBD to discuss issues around gender-based violence on Saturday 30 November. The event is organised by the United Nations Association of South Africa (Unasa), a non-profit organisation that promotes community engagement, with the same principles of the United Nations (UN). It will be held as part of the annual 16 Days of Activism campaign commemorated between Monday 25 November to Sunday 10 December. Under the theme Orange the World: Gender Equality Stands Against Rape, Unasa to convey a message that gender-based violence needs to stop. Unasa works with youth from 13 to 14 years old, from schools in disadvantaged communities. It wants to change the attitude of young men towards young girls and women, “that when she says no, that it is not a challenge but her will and right to refuse”. “We feel that to discuss this issue openly and honestly, we need to remove them from their environment. However, getting reliable and safe transport to and from these areas is one of our many challenges in having a successful event,” says Mariam Salie, the project, and administration manager at Unasa. She says they will also bring across the message that bullying at school is a form of gender-based violence. Salie says the issue of gender-based violence is a big problem in South Africa. She says while there is support for victims, there are not enough platforms to educate youth about their behaviour towards women. “We need to ensure that gender-based violence stops,” says Salie. Though they have received support, Salie says they have a R150 000 shortfall for transport. She appeals to anyone that may help to support the initiative and allow youth to discuss the matters in a comfortable platform.
