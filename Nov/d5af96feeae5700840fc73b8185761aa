National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Strandfontein duty crew were activated to assist in the search for two locals who had gone missing in the surf on Monday 18 November at 10:23. Despite an extensive sea, air and shoreline search no sign of the missing man and teenager was found. A 22-year-old man from Port Elizabeth, and a 17-year-old boy from Delft, was reported to be in difficulty and went missing in the surfline at Garbage Beach, west of Mnandi Beach. A man who was with both of the victims while they were swimming, had reportedly also been in difficulty in the surf and managed to get out unharmed.
