A missing Durban woman who was brazenly kidnapped from Pinetown six months ago has been found, the Hawks confirmed on Friday. "We will provide more information at a later stage, but I can confirm that she is recovering in hospital," Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi told News24. Sandra Moonsamy, the 40-year-old financial director of multi-billion rand company Crossmoor Transport, was found after an operation in Mamelodi, Pretoria, said the Hawks. Other media reports however said she was found in Witbank in eMalahleni. "We have arrested four people at this stage. I believe some firearms have been recovered, but I will confirm that later," said Mulaudzi. Moonsamy was kidnapped in May on the M13 on Stapleton Road in Pinetwon, while driving her black Range Rover.
