Springbok supporters in Durban waited with much anticipation for the world champions to drive through their streets during the second leg of their nationwide trophy tour on Friday. Residents, clad in green and gold, lined the streets from the team's hotel in Umhlanga, all the way to Durban's City Hall in the CBD in support of the newly-crowned world champions. Fans were particularly excited to catch a glimpse of legendary Springbok propÂ Tendai "Beast" Mtawarira who started off his career in KwaZulu-Natal. The Bokke, sponsored by telecommunications company MTN, will continue their tour over the weekend visiting East London, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town.
