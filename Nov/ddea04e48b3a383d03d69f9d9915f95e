The case between axed Public Protector COO Basani Baloyi and the Public Protector herself has been postponed to Wednesday in the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. According to one of the lawyers in the matter, the case had to be postponed because there were too many matters on Tuesday's court roll. Baloyi has taken the Public Protector and her chief executive officer, Vusi Mahlangu, to court over what she deems to be a purge by Busisiwe Mkhwebane.

Baloyi wants the court to declare that Mkhwebane acted unconstitutionally, violating her obligations towards independence.
