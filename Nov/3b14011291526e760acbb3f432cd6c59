The heavy rains in KwaZulu-Natal have struck again, this time claiming a seven-year-old boy who was swept away while walking home from school. On Tuesday, IPSS spokesperson Dylan Meyrick said rescue teams were searching the Nonoti River in Darnell, Durban. "The [seven-year-old] was walking home from school and was washed off a low-level bridge. The river is in full flood." The search had to be called off at around 17:30 due to poor weather conditions and lightning, said IPSS spokesperson Paul Herbst. "The search will continue at first light tomorrow [Wednesday] morning, weather dependent," he added.
