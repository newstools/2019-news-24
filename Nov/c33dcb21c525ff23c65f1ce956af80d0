Rescue operations to find three people are still continuing after a person was declared dead in a drowning tragedy in Sea Point on Sunday, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) spokesperson Craig Lambinon said. Three NSRI stations, a Skymed helicopter and emergency medical services were scrambled when the alarm was raised over four people, including a woman who had gone missing in the surf. Earlier, surfers found the body of a male, and an NSRI rescue swimmer swam out to them. CPR was initiated and on the arrival of the first sea rescue craft, he was put on board and taken to the Three Anchor Bay slipway. "Despite extensive CPR efforts, that male, believed to be in his early 20s, has been declared deceased," said Lambinon. *This story has been updated to note that only one body has been found. News24 erroneously reported that two bodies had been recovered.
