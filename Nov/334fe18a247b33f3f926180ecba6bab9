HAVE you ever felt your vehicle shake on its axle from the displacement of air when another vehicle passes at a hairâ€™s breadth away, travelling at high speed? If not, experience this delectable occurrence by queuing up in College Road at peak hours. Recently, someone came out of a driveway and crossed the middle lane race track while blinded by the vehicles in the queue, in order to turn right. A speeding vehicle stopped with just a few centimetres to spare. Should the vehicle have come out a fraction of a second later, there would have been a major collision and possibly loss of lives. Are the authorities totally blind to the situation in College Road? A suggestion is to close the middle lane. People will then overtake in the right lane, but at least it will guarantee safety for those driving out of their yards, as well as remove the highest likelihood of the cause of an accident. Another idea is to make College Road a one way street, from Alexandra Road. JACQUES POIRIER College Road
