"It's time for South Africans to start believing in themselves again." This was the message from Anglican Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and his wife, Leah, as praise was heaped on the victorious Springboks after their 32-12 Rugby World Cup win over England on Saturday. "We are incredibly proud to be South Africans," the Tutus said in a statement. "What a fantastic achievement from Siya Kolisi, Rassie Erasmus, all the players and staff.

They also urged the team to be role models to curb gender-based violence. "We are also very proud of the team for bringing the cup home. We are very proud of the team and cherish their resilient spirit." One of the team's sponsors, Samsung, said the Boks might not have gone into the contest as favourites, but they were champions now.
