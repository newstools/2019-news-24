A 91-year-old
woman was rescued by police after reportedly being locked and abandoned in her
home for nearly two weeks with barely any food. Luisa Victoria
Sanchez Gemio, from Lima in Peru had been receiving food from neighbours through
her window for 10 days. “I haven’t eaten
much. I saved some rice from yesterday and I ate it this morning,” Luisa told
local reporters who arrived on the scene as she was about to be rescued. Footage shows
the elderly woman being helped by police reassuring her that they’re there to
help her. According to
police commander Manuel Alvarado, this wasn’t the first time the woman had been
left alone for a long period of time. “It’s the second time she’s been abandoned
by her relatives,” he says. “There’s a police report from 18 October
2018 where a complaint was filed against 61-year-old Max Orlando Chupa Sanchez
for psychological abuse. We’re still trying to find him.” Luisa is now being cared for in a nursing
home in a nearby district. Sources:
