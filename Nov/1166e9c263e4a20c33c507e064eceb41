"The case was prioritised and duly treated with urgency, only to establish that the case was based on a fabricated story," she said. "Preliminary investigation confirmed that the complainant opened a false rape case." She was arrested and expected to appear in court soon for perjury. Peters warned people to refrain from opening false rape cases as it diverted resources from genuine cases. "In the same tone, police are appealing to victims of rape not to be silent but report as soon as possible."
