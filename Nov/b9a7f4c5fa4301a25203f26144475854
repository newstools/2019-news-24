AFTER 13 years without water, Mcoseleli High School in Maqongqo received a bore-hole donation from Gift of The Givers. The bore-hole was officially handed over to the school last Wednesday, much to the relief of pupils, staff and community members. The bore-hole will not only supply the school with water but will also supply community members who live nearby. During it’s installation, pipes were connected to the bore-hole that will give the community access to water from outside the school premises. Echo previously reported on the struggles that community members in this area faced regarding the supply of water. The school and community previously had to rely on water tankers that were sometimes unable to accommodate their needs, forcing them to turn to the nearby river, also used by livestock, for their water supply. About a month ago there was service delivery protest in the area and one of the issues that was on top of the agenda was the need for clean and running water for the community. This community last had running water in their taps in 2006. Khulekani Kunene from Gift of The Givers said they decided to help the school after they saw the community and the school suffering. “I remember we were going to do a project in this area and all the entrances were closed due to the protest. We then decided to donate a bore-hole to assist the school and the community members in the area. “This is the first bore-hole project that we have done in Pietermaritzburg. We have done a lot in other areas, like Estcourt and others, that were having a water [supply] problem,” he said, adding that they decided to put in pipes that would assist the community as well as the school. Simo Mazibuko, a teacher at the school, said this project is going to be a great help for children and the community as a whole. “Teachers used to carry their own drinking water to school because of this problem of not having water. “We are very grateful to Gift of The Givers,” said Mazibuko.
