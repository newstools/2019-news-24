The
idea that your puppy ages seven years for every human year has finally been
debunked. A
new study suggests that dog years are a complete myth and that our furry
friends don’t age seven years for every
human year, as commonly believed. Researchers
at the University of California claim that puppies are middle-aged by the age
of two, Independent reports. According
to the study, by the time your dog gets to the age of three, it’s roughly the
same age as a 50-year-old person. The
study looked at ageing in dogs by focusing
on a natural process called DNA methylation in more than 100 labradors,
according to The Telegraph. The
DNA contains marks that change over time, allowing the researchers to track the
animal’s biological age. After
assessing the results from the study, they compared the findings with those
from 300 humans, Daily Mail reports. But
the ageing does slow down so there’s no need to worry. By the age of 10, in
human years, a dog is about 68 years old. Researchers
say that the expected life expectancy of 12 years for labradors is similar to
the life expectancy of 70 years for humans, according to The Telegraph. Sources: Independent, The
