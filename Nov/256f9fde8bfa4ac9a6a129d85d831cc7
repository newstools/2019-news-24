Willem Breytenbach, a former teacher-turned-journalist who became an executive at Media24 before he left the company in 2014, is accused of raping a schoolboy more than 20 years ago when he headed-up a school newspaper project for the company. On Thursday, News24 and Deon Wiggett, in a four-part true-crime podcast titled My Only Story, tracks down Breytenbach, who allegedly sexually assaulted many boys and young men since at least 1990. Breytenbach has gone to ground since the first episode of My Only Story flighted on News24 two weeks ago. He abandoned his house in Cape Town and told most of his almost 30 colleagues at his digital marketing firm Lightspeed Digital Media to resign. He switched off his cellphone and closed all his social media accounts. On Monday, Wiggett opened a case with the police who are investigating his and other complaints. In the third episode of his podcast, Wiggett unmasked the man he had previously referred to as "Jimmy" as Breytenbach, a former Grey College teacher, who moved to Hoërskool Willowmore in the Eastern Cape and Hoërskool Langenhoven in Riversdale, before joining Die Burger as an education reporter in 1995.
