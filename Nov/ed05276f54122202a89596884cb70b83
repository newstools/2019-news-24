A
distracted commuter was caught on CCTV footage walking straight off the
platform and onto the train tracks while on his phone. The startling scenes were recorded at the Estrecho Metro Station
in Madrid, Spain. On the footage passengers are seen waiting on the platform when
a train pulls into the opposite side of the station. The train moves in the direction of the passenger, who simultaneously
stands up and begins walking towards the tracks. The unnamed passenger is staring at his mobile phone and then
walks straight off the platform and onto the tracks in front of the oncoming
train. While it’s
reported that the passenger is unharmed after the incident, authorities shared
the footage to remind customers not to be distracted by their mobile phones. “For your security, look up from your mobile phone when you
are walking on the platform,” they captioned the clip. “Not looking up from your mobile phone while you are waiting
for the metro could turn out to be a costly distraction.” Sources: Magazine
