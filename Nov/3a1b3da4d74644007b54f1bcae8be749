FORMER Mountain Rise SAPS member Captain Ramsawak Sunker recently celebrated his 80th birthday. While Sunker was a constable stationed at Mountain Rise, he walked daily to the Magistrate’s Court and back again with a bundle of case dockets under his arm, never utilising state transport. Sunker, who received his matric certificate at the age of 53 in 1993, was forced to pursue the certificate in order for him to be promoted to the rank of captain. Former officer of the law Logan Govender said he recently had the privilege and pleasure of visiting an erstwhile colleague. “Retired Captain Ramsawak Sunker, affectionately known as Sunker bhai by all his colleagues, has always been an extremely selfless person,” said Govender. Sunker said, at this late age, he has obtained several certificates in Hindu studies from various institutions and he is still busy studying. He is currently pursuing a certificate in religious Educare. The 80-year-old is also an active member of the Divine Life Society of South Africa. In speaking on his secret to a long life, Sunker highlighted that he has also walked the fire at the local temple and is an active member of a Satsang yoga group. Govender said that what stood out to him about Sunker and his late wife’s lives was when they brought up their grandson. “They put all their financial resources into this lad. They educated him and sent him to medical school in Durban. He is now an anaesthesiologist based at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. Sunker bhai you have done us proud,” said Govender.
