EFF leader Julius Malema claimed that if he had assaulted the police officer who accused him of common assault, he would have "panelbeated" him. The officer in question alleges that Malema and EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi assaulted him last year at the funeral of struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Malema and Ndlozi appeared in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday morning in connection with the allegations. Magistrate Liesl Davis postponed the case to March 10, 2020 to give the accused and National Prosecuting Authority time to hold consultations, and make representations and disclosures before the trial starts.
