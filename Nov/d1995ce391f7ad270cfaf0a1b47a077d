Springbok supporters in East London went all out on Saturday to welcome their heroes and
the golden Webb Ellis Cup home. The
Boks were swarmed by a sea of supporters, stretching as far as the eye could
see, at their first stop outside City Hall. Screaming,
hooting and flag-waving fans lined the streets from the city centre all the way
to rural Mdantsane, where Makazole Mapimpi hails from.  Scores of people came out to support the Springboks on their trophy tour through East London on Saturday. (Photo: Chante Schatz/News24) Mapimpi
told journalists that all he really wants to do is play rugby. "It's
a big achievement to play for the Springboks, to play in the World Cup and win
a trophy, for me, it's like history," he said. The
Bok wing made the record books a week ago by becoming the first ever Springbok
to score a try in a Rugby World Cup final. Later
in the day, doctors and patients at Frere Hospital joined in on the
celebrations, and a local soccer match in Amalinda was stopped so that players,
and the referee, could catch a glimpse of the Springboks.  The Springbok players waved to thousands of supporters who lined up in the streets of East London on their trophy tour. (Photo: Chante Schatz/News24) Captain Siya Kolisi, Mapimpi and centre Lukhanyo Am later triumphantly lifted the Webb
Ellis Cup on top of the bus. Kolisi and Am are also sons of the Eastern Cape. The
Boks touched down in Port Elizabeth late on Saturday afternoon, where Kolisi
led the charge as the team left the airport. He grew up in Zwide in Port
Elizabeth, and fans were expected to turn out in their droves when he and the
rest of the team travelled to his hometown on Sunday.
