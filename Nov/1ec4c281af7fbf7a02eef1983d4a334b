The
recent reporting and updates on Senzo Meyiwa’s murder, from the Police Chief,
to the Police Minister of Police, has felt like a slap in my families’
face. I feel for Senzo's family and understand their pain and
anguish. I also feel for my family. We lost my uncle who was
murdered in front of his children, in July 2014. Nothing has been said
about his case, instead, it was classified as cold, before even witnesses were
interviewed and is now closed. I feel equally for all other families who
have lost their loved ones. Our stories are never told. Why? Because we
are not famous, important, known? Our investigations never make it past
the crime itself being reported. It hurts when so much publicity and
investigations are being made about one individual, when so many other murders
are unsolved and not assigned to an investigator. All lives matter. May all the souls that have departed under such brutal circumstances rest in
peace. And may all cases be treated equally. Motshabi Nomvethe Parktown, Gauteng
