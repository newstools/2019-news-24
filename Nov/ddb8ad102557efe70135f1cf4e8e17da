A 23-year-old Tanzanian woman has been
arrested for card-scamming after 23 ATM cards were foudn in her panties after a
body search was conducted on her. Halima Juma was arrested on Tuesday at the CRDB
Bank ATM in Mbagala, Dar es Salaam, after a bank teller became suspicious of
her behavior, K24Tv reports. The teller rang the alarm after noticing Juma
had been using different ATM cards to withdraw large sums of cash from the same
ATM. Upon arrest, a body search was conducted on
Juma, which yielded 23 ATM cards from nine different Tanzanian banks. According
to Pulse, Juma confessed to authorities that she was part of
an ATM-card syndicate. Dar es Salaam regional police boss Lazaro
Mambosasa confirmed that Juma was caught on several surveillance cameras withdrawing
large sums of money using the different cards in different ATM rooms. Mambosasa
further explained that Juma admitted that the cards were obtained using
deceptive means and that targets were old, illiterate rich men and women. “She said they have been targeting the
elderly rich but illiterate men and women. They pretend to help them withdraw
money from ATMs. She said they usually ask the user for their PINs and once
they reveal the information, they lie to them that the ATM card has been
‘swallowed’. So they should report to their respective banks the following day.
Thereafter they go to another ATM and withdraw the money,” Mambosasa said. Kenyan news and website Tuko
also reported that Juma’s syndicate would not only target people at ATMs, but
those who withdrew money from tellers. While the client would be counting their
money before putting it away, they would swiftly exchange the client’s card for
a similar looking one.
