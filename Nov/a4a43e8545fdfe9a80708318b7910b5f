"Yes, that's right, he was found," said police spokesperson, Warrant Officer Joshua Maistry, as word of the sad discovery spread. "It is indeed very sad to lose such a person who has been a stalwart in Pietermaritzburg, more so to the Northdale community that knew him very well," he added in a later statement. Singh went missing last Tuesday, with The Witness reporting that he was last seen leaving his surgery on Dr Chota Motala Road (Old Greytown Road). His white BMW was reportedly found near Howick Falls on Tuesday afternoon. A search which included divers and dogs from the K9 unit had worked to try and find him, while his family anxiously waited for news.
