The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has confirmed that it has charged EFF leader Julius Malema for allegedly firing a weapon in public during a party rally in the Eastern Cape in 2018. In a statement, NPA Eastern Cape spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said Malema faces five charges, including the unlawful possession of a firearm. The four other counts are the unlawful possession of ammunition, the discharge of a firearm in a public place, failure to take reasonable precaution to prevent danger to a person or property and reckless endangerment to a person or property. Security official Adriaan Snyman has also been charged. Snyman faces two counts: a failure to take reasonable precautions to prevent danger to a person or property and providing a firearm or ammunition to any person who is not allowed to possess one.

In September, News24 reported that the NPA had decided whether or not it should charge Malema. But, at the time, Tyali said the decision could not be revealed. Days after the News24 report, Malema said the case against him was a mockery of the system. Malema added that after getting advice from his lawyers, he did not think there was anything to answer to, adding that the Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation was "mischievous".
