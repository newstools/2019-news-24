President Cyril Ramaphosa was "elated" by the Springboks' victory over England in the Rugby World Cup final in Japan on Saturday. "The boys have outshone everyone in the world. They are the best; they are the best team," he said in a statement after speaking to captain Siya Kolisi. "When I spoke to them hours before the match, I could see in their eyes that they were really determined, and they have delivered a great victory. It was really Go Bokke! "We are the champions; indeed, we are the champions of the world." Ramaphosa congratulated Kolisi, coach Rassie Erasmus, the technical staff, tournament squad, the team on the day and leadership of SA Rugby for securing the Webb Ellis Cup at the first Rugby World Cup to be staged in Asia.
