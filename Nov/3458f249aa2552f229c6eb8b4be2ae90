A 23-year-old
woman was shot in the face – allegedly by her ex-boyfriend – in a fake armed
robbery. Renata Ranyelle Almeida, a store clerk from São
Miguel in Brazil, was at work when a masked man entered the store and forced
the three female employees to the back area near the cash register, Daily
Mail reports. A surveillance
camera inside the clothing store showed how terrified Renata was when the
suspect approached her with a firearm and demanded cash, Mirror
UK reports. The young woman
calmly follows instructions as she places the cash bin on top of the counter. But
despite her cooperation the gunman shot her in the face. Instead of
leaving the store with the money the man unloads his gun, runs out and gets on
a motorcycle before fleeing the scene. He remains on the run. Renata was
rushed to a local hospital and remains in a serious condition. Her family told
police they believe her ex-boyfriend was behind the attack. “As seen in the security
camera recordings, the young woman doesn’t react in any way, and yet the
criminal still shoots her,” police delegate Cristiano Gouveia says. “That’s why
people think he went there with the aim of killing her.” Sources: Daily
