A man who had been reported missing after he was hijacked along with his car in Winchester Hills, was dumped by his hijackers in Noordgesig on Saturday evening. Passersby helped him get to the Orlando police station where he received assistance. His white BMW was also recovered after South African Police Service (SAPS) members responded to reports of a suspicious car in Klipspruit West. This led suspects inside the car to flee, BrigadierÂ Mathapelo Peters said in a statement. Ebrahim Moola (28) hijacked in Winchester Hills and taken hostage. His car has been recovered.

In a statement, Sitole ordered a manhunt for the alleged cop killers. "At approximately 20:00 last night a captain and a warrant officer responded to a hijacking complaint at Leonie Street, Winchester Hills, shortly after he (the captain) visited the Booysens police station as the duty officer," SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said. Police said it was unclear whether the officials were responding to the hijacking in which the white BMW was taken. "Initial reports suggest the two members came under fire and they were both fatally wounded at Vleiroos Street while on their way to the complaint." "We cannot rest until these killers have been found," said General Sitole. "While police are working around the clock to find these killers, we want to also appeal to anyone with information to please contact our Crime Stop number 08600 10111," Sitole added. Callers may remain anonymous and all information will be treated with the strictest confidence. People were also encouraged to download My SAPS app via the Google Play store.
