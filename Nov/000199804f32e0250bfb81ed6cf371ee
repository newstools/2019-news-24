An elderly woman was rescued by
police after being stuck in her bath with no food for eight days. The 70-year-old woman, from Loughborough in
England, could access tap water but was unable to get any food for more than a
week because she couldn’t climb out of the bathtub, Metro UK
reports. Authorities were called to the unnamed woman’s
property after concerns were raised about her welfare, Mirror UK
reports. A food delivery driver had alerted police when he was unable to get hold
of her on the phone to deliver her regular meals, BBC reports. "She's a regular customer who
orders through us every week and when she didn't contact us on her regular day,
we knew something was wrong," said Len Bateman, from Wiltshire Farm Foods. "I might not have acted so
quickly if I knew she had friends or family, and when she didn't answer the
door I knew I needed to get help,” he added. "It must’ve been very hard for
her. I don't know how much longer she might have lasted there." Officers managed to get the woman out of the
bath and paramedics were called to carry out a medical assessment. The woman is now
recovering in hospital. Sources: Metro UK,
