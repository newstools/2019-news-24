A suspect has been charged with robbery and murder after a woman was found dead outside her Graaff-Reinet house on Sunday, her body wrapped in a blanket. The 32-year-old man will appear in the Graaff-Reinet Magistrate's Court on Monday after he was found in possession of the woman's belongings. The police responded to a call from a Santaville resident and found Julian Lukas, 63, wrapped in a blanket outside her home, spokesperson Captain Bradley Rawlinson said in a statement.
