Mozambique's largest opposition party Renamo has lost its bid to annul last month's election results after the country's top court threw out its challenge, according to a court judgement seen on Friday. Renamo, the rebel group turned opposition party, lodged an application after it lost the October 15 election to the long-ruling Frelimo party. It accused the government of "massive electoral fraud" and of using violence and intimidation on voting day in a breach of a peace deal between the two parties who once fought a civil war. But the Constitutional Court, in a judgement dated November 11 but seen on its website on Friday, rejected the application on grounds that the party "did not submit enough evidence to sustain it's complaint". Last week the European Union cast doubt on the credibility of the ruling party's victory, saying its observers detected a litany of "irregularities and malpractices" and called on authorities to clarify them. Mozambican civil society and international observers had already flagged numerous alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes and chase away election monitors, as well as hundreds of thousands of so-called "ghost voters" on the electoral roll. Incumbent President Filipe Nyusi won a new five-year term after his Frelimo party secured 73% of the votes cast. The election posed a major challenge to the country's already fragile peace agreement between Frelimo and Renamo who fought a civil war from 1975-1992 that left one million dead.
