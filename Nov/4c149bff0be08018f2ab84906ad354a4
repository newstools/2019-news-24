As the doors of Game in Canal Walk, Cape Town opened, frantic bargain hunters grabbed their trolleys and headed straight to find the perfect television. Within minutes the tech section of the store was flooded with customers waiting for their TV licences to be processed. "I got the TV I was looking for, but now I'm just trying not to fall asleep. I'm exhausted," Bongumusa Khumalo, who had been waiting for close to an hour, told News24. For some, Black Friday isn't only about indulging in tech splurges - household necessities were also high on the list. Following strict instructions from home, Byron Arendse, from Bellville, said: "My wife wants me to clean, so I bought myself an ironing boardâ€¦ I also bought a new iron, because you can't buy the one without the other." Meandering lines of trollies grew as shoppers made their way to the tills. Game manager Nizaam Dramat was pleased that Black Friday went off without a hitch. "Customer safety was important for us. We wanted to create a safe shopping environment," he said. The shop has extended its trading hours to accommodate the Black Friday frenzy.
