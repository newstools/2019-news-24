Gauteng police are on the hunt for a group of men who killed a woman during a hijacking in Bramley, north of Johannesburg, on Friday morning. The incident happened at around 06:00 when the men pounced on the woman while she was driving her white Kia Rio on Cunning and Dublin roads, police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela said. The woman was an employee working in the finance department at Emer-G-Med ambulance services, the company's Chief Operating Officer, Jurgen Kotze said. "[She] was on her way to work at the time of the incident," Kotze told News24. In a graphic video which has gone viral on social media, a white vehicle in which the woman is travelling in is seen approaching a traffic light. When the vehicle comes to a stop, four men are seen approaching it, pointing firearms. It seems the victim tried to flee before they shoot her. The men then drag her out the car before fleeing with it. Makhubela said the vehicle was recovered on 6th Avenue street in Alexandra, less than 3 kilometres away from the scene of the crime. The suspects are still at large.
