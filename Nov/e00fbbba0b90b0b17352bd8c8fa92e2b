Vehicle testing examiners, licensing officials and a driving school
operator have been arrested in Limpopo for allegedly issuing fraudulent drivers'
licences. Three arrests were made after a sting operation was conducted at the
Sibasa driver's licence testing centre in Thohoyandou, according to Road
Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) spokesperson Simon Zwane. Officers at the RTMC's national traffic anti-corruption unit received a
tip-off that drivers' licences were fraudulently issued to applicants for a
fee. The officers enlisted the help of the Limpopo division of the Hawks to
stage the sting operation at the testing centre, which led to the arrest of a driving
school operator and two examiners – a man and a woman – on Friday. During the operation, officers also seized documents. The three people have been detained at the Thohoyandou police station and
are expected to appear in court next week. In another operation on Friday, three vehicle testing examiners were
arrested for a second time, in Marble Hall, for allegedly fraudulently issuing
vehicle roadworthy certificates for vehicles they never tested. The arrests took place at a private vehicle testing station, which was
previously raided by the anti-corruption unit and the Hawks. The people who
were arrested were out on bail following their arrest for similar allegations
last month. "Another two suspects are being sought in connection with these
allegations," Zwane said. Around 30 vehicle examiners were arrested in Limpopo last month on charges
of fraud relating to the issuing of vehicle roadworthy certificates. "Corruption and fraud are a major influence in the high number of road
fatalities in the country and the RTMC has prioritised this crime in efforts to
make South African roads safe. Members of the public to assist by reporting
suspected bribery, fraud and corruption on 0861 400 800 or by emailing ntacu@rtmc.co.za," Zwane said.
