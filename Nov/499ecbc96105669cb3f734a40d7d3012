A woman accidentally
hit and killed her two-year-old son – four years after losing her young
daughter in a similar incident. According to the
Hillsborough county sheriff’s office in Florida, USA, the accident happened
when the child’s mother and grandmother were test-driving their 4x4, which was
experiencing transmission difficulties, on a private road, People
reports. Four years ago the
woman’s two-year-old daughter died after falling out of an open door of
relatives' car, according to Tampa Bay Times. The sheriff’s office
spokesperson said that to make sure the car was working after it started
stalling, the youngster's mom put it in reverse, drove forward and put it back
in reverse, News Channel 8 reports. The woman had spotted
her two-year-old son in the front yard with the family’s dog and thought he’d
let himself and the pooch into the house. After reversing for the
first time, the mom said she thought she’d hit a piece of wood. But when she
saw the dog outside, she realised that her son was probably outside as well. “Some two-year-olds do
have the ability to open a door on their own,” the spokesperson said. “They left the toddler
and a dog inside the house at the time, so when they saw the dog was outside in
the yard, it’s a clear indicator that, ‘Oh no, our child is likely in the yard
as well.’” The woman jumped out of
her car to discover her son's body on the ground. The boy was flown to hospital
but died of his injuries. “It’s an absolutely
tragic accident,” the spokesperson said. “Families have to be extremely
cautious whenever they have children out in the yard when their vehicles are
running.” “We always ask that you
make sure before getting in your vehicle and starting that car, you check
around the vehicle to make sure no children or pets are there.” Police are
investigating the incident. Sources: People, News
