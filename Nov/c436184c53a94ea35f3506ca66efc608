If you're near Upington in Northern Cape on Sunday you can have your say at one of the public hearings on the controversial National Insurance Bill, Parliament's portfolio committee on health said. The hearing will be held at the Dawid Kruiper Local Municipality's Toll Speelman Hall from 10:00. "The objective of the Bill is to achieve universal access to quality health care services in South Africa in accordance with section 27 of the Constitution; to establish a National Health Insurance Fund and to set out its powers, functions and governance structures; and to provide a framework for the strategic purchasing of health care services by the fund on behalf of users," the committee explained. NHI is the government's plan to provide universal healthcare access to all South Africans. It is expected to be rolled out by 2026 and is estimated to cost R256bn.

"The National Treasury assisted the Department of Health to develop an actuarial model with updated fiscal costs and limited policy reforms to strengthen the current healthcare system."The revised model estimates that rolling out NHI would require an additional R33bn annually from 2025/26.
