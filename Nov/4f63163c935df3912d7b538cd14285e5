District Six residents have welcomed the removal of the mini bus taxis from Sir Lowry Road to Foreshore in the CBD. Taxis which were displaced during the upgrade of the Station Deck, had moved to a temporary holding area on Sir Lowry Road, to the dismay of residents who said this attracted drugs and prostitution to District Six. Mohamed Mustapha Shaik, treasurer of District Six Civic Association, said they had asked the City of Cape Town to deal with the problem and the taxis were removed on Wednesday 12 November. “We approached the mayor with our problem and he promised he would get rid of the taxis under the bridge. They were removed and we are very grateful for that. It was terrible, we could not even walk there,” says Shaik. He says the problem had been going on for about six months. Felicity Purchase, Mayco member for transport says 250 taxis were displaced during the refurbishment of the station deck. The City has since moved these taxis to a new temporary site on the Foreshore which can accommodate 270 taxis. She says there will be law enforcement to ensure compliance. The layout of the Station Deck will also be reviewed to accommodate more taxis during off-peak.
