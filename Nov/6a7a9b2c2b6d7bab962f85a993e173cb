The Department of Employment and Labour warns the public against a scam being run via a fake website resembling that of the department. The scam keeps resurfacing on social media. The website says, “workers who have worked between 1990 and 2019 have the right to withdraw R30 000 from Ministry of Labor and Social Security”. The department appeals to the public to not respond to offers of a financial nature they are not entitled to. Report suspicious acts to the police or the fraud hotline on 086-002-2194 or fraud@labour.gov.za.
