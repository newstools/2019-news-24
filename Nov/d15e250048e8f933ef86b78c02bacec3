Still in the celebratory haze of their Rugby World Cup win, some of the Springboks have decided to commemorate their victory with matching tattoos of a springbok and the Web Ellis trophy.

"The Bokke were such sweet people, I can't believe that guys that just won the cup are so humble and kind", Kaye said.

They took time out on Thursday evening from their busy schedule to celebrate their victory in a more personal way.
