A patient accidentally fell out of a moving ambulance when
the door swung open. The shocking incident, which took place in the city of
Novomoskovsk in eastern Ukraine, was recorded on the dashboard camera of a
vehicle driving behind the ambulance. In the video, the vehicle is driving down the road when the
doors of the ambulance in front of it swing open. The driver, in an attempt to get the ambulanceâ€™s attention,
then hoots as he approaches a dark object on the road, which turns out to be
the male patient. The patient can be seen lying on the tarmac as the driver
continues to hoot before getting out and walking towards the man. Moments later two of the ambulance workers come towards the
man. The unidentified male patient ended up bruising his head, according
to reports. It remains unclear why he was being taken to hospital. He eventually made it to a clinic accompanied by the
police, local media outlets report. Sources: Magazine
