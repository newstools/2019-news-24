A suspect arrested for the murder of a Strand man is expected in the local magistrate's court on Monday. The 56-year-old man’s body was discovered in his Beach Road flat in the Cape Town suburb at around 10:40 on Friday, police spokesperson Colonel Andrè Traut confirmed. The suspect was arrested shortly afterwards. “Investigations led to the arrest of a 30-year-old suspect close to the crime scene who was found in possession of the victim’s property," Traut said. Netwerk24 identified the victim as 56-year-old Eldie Gerber, a director and license holder of property group Seeff Strand. Gerber was reportedly part of Seeff for 25 years. It is understood Gerber is survived by a son.
