When snake catcher Nick Evans rescued an African rock python from a river in KwaZulu-Natal, he ended up saving 30 more in the process. As it turned out, the momma snake was pregnant. A man who had attended one of his snake awareness workshops called Evans at 06:30 on Thursday to notify him of a python he had spotted in Molweni, Inanda. The man had already left the scene, but Evans pleaded with him to go back to ensure that no harm had come to the python. "He stood there and made sure nobody killed it. Apparently, people were throwing rocks at it." Evans said locals were worried about the safety of their children. The python eventually sought shelter under some rocks in a nearby river. "When I got there, it was a very cold snake. It wasn't moving very much." He struggled to free the python from under the rocks, but got there eventually. "It was cold and damn heavy," he laughed. And then he noticed swelling close to the snake's tail. "If a snake has eaten something there is a huge bulge in the middle. But when the back half is swollen, that's normally a sign of pregnancy." Evans took the python to a medical facility where it was X-rayed. It sustained no injuries, but his suspicions were confirmed. The 3.3m female python, weighing 17.5kg, was indeed pregnant. Evans said it was hard to say just how many eggs there were. "I'm going to guess about 30. We had a 4m python last year that laid 44 eggs." Evans said pythons were amazing mothers and they not only guarded their eggs, but incubated them as well. It is not yet clear when the python will be released back into the wild. Evans said he was quite anxious despite the snake not having any injuries. "I would be devastated if something goes wrong [with the pregnancy]."
