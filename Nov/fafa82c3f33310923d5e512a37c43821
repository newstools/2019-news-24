Senior state advocate Addelaid Ferreira-Watt has died after she was shot at the regional court in Ixopo, KwaZulu-Natal, in what appears to be an accident on Monday. Police says Ferreira-Watt was admitted to hospital after she was hit in the hip when a loaded shotgun went off in court. Officials say the weapon was brought to court to be admitted as evidence in a house robbery case. Several people, including former Hawks KZN boss Johan Booysen, have expressed their shock at Ferreira-Watt's death.  This is a developing story. More information to follow. Compiled by Sheldon Morais
