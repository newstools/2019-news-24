The dust may have settled on the whirlwind 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, but the party has only just started for the Springboks. The newly crowned Rugby World Cup winners hopped on an open-top bus for a trophy tour across the country. Thousands of people, young and old, came out to see the champions.  Monday was Cape Town’s turn to welcome the Webb Ellis cup home. The Springboks started their tour with a visit to Parliament before heading to Cape Town City Hall to address fans.  Carlo Geswindt and his son travelled from Delft to be at the City Hall at 6am. He says he wanted to show his son the uniting power the Springboks have. "They unite us, we have a lot struggles, but the bokke have given us hope for the future," he said. Geswindt was among the thousands who lined the streets of Cape Town to catch a glimpse of the most coveted prize in world rugby.  The bus then made its way to Langa, and then snaked its way along the N2 towards Elsies River and Belhar, were the bus passed the University of the Western Cape — the alma mater of pocket rocket scrumhalf Herschel Jantjies. Jantjies was part of the late 1995 World Cup winner Chester Williams' 2017 'Varsity Shield' squad.  "Welcome to Elsies! AmaBokke!" and "Bokke we are proud of you!" were sprayed on massive white sheets tied to lamp posts as the Springboks made their way through Uitsig to Elsies River. Already late in the day, massive crowds of supporters gathered around the bus cheering as captain Siya Kolisi waved the trophy. Visibly drained after the five-day victory lap, the top rugby team in the world still had some juice in their tank to thank their die-hard supporters.
