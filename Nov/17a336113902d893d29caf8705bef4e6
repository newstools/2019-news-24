A 64-year-old serial rapist was recently sentenced to six
life terms by the Pinetown Regional Court in KwaZulu-Natal. The suspect was found guilty of rape, compelled rape and
sexual assault. The entire investigation was conducted by detectives at the
Chatsworth Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS). Convicted rapist Sipho Mfene, who was out on parole for a
previous rape he committed, lured both boys and girls who range from the ages
seven and eleven to his home in St Wendolins, Mariannhill where he would rape
them. In 2017, Mfene raped an eight-year-old girl. When community
leaders were made aware of the incident, they caught Mfene and handed him over
to the Mariannhill police where he was detained. Eight other victims also came forward to open sexual
assault cases against Mfene which lead to him being denied bail. He then remained in police custody following his arrest in
2017 until his sentencing this week. Speaking to DRUM, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner
Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula, said that he is impressed by the
detectives at the FCS Unit for the successful prosecution of the serial rapist. “As we are about to launch the 16 Days of Activism
Campaign, let us become ambassadors with a common goal to protect women and
children in society.” He further added that he would like to encourage victims to
seek help from the police through various help desks and to never allow
perpetrators to have power over their lives. “The courage displayed by these young victims at criminal
proceedings has restored faith in the police and the justice system.” “Police will continue to root out criminals who commit
heinous acts against our women and children.” “I believe that together we can make this province a safe
and better place for everyone,” he said.
