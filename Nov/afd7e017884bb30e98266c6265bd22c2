French arms dealer Thales has approached the highest court in South Africa to extricate itself from former president Jacob Zuma's criminal trial. Thales confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that it approached the Constitutional Court on November 1 for leave to appeal a ruling by the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg dismissing its application for a permanent stay of prosecution. Meanwhile, Zuma filed his papers in the High Court on November 1, also seeking to appeal the court’s decision. On October 11, judges Thoba Poyo-Dlwati, Bhekisisa Mnguni and Esther Steyn dismissed both Zuma and Thales’ applications for a permanent stay of prosecution with costs.
