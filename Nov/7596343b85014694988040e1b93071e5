The 33-year-old former Bryanston High School sports coach accused of sexual harassment will today find out whether the Director of Public Prosecutions will review the decision to prosecute him. The former coach - who may not be named as he is yet to plead – was arrested in January after a 17-year-old pupil at the school and her mother opened a case against him, News24 previously reported. It is unclear on what basis the former coach wants the decision to be reviewed.
