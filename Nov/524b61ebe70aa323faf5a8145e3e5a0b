A man died and a woman sustained serious burn wounds in a house fire in Delft on Thursday morning, the City of Cape Town's Fire and Rescue Services says. Spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said a maisonette in Owen Madikane Street caught fire in the early hours of the morning. The fire was contained to the ground floor, but firefighters found the body of a man who had died as a result of burn wounds. Rescuers also found a woman who had sustained 60% burn wounds. She was treated and transported to a nearby hospital. The scene was cordoned off and handed over to the police for investigation.
