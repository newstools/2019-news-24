INVESTIGATIONS against a city police officer by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) are expected to start soon following allegations    that he raped a woman at the weekend. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said yesterday that the woman opened the case at the Pietermaritzburg police station before it was transferred to Prestbury, and then to IPID. The woman was allegedly working as a sex worker in town on Sunday when she was approached by a man driving a silver car. The woman reported the man signalled for her to come over and she got into the car and drove with him to a block of flats in the city. It is alleged the officer pulled out his gun and placed it on top of the fridge, and then got out his police badge and showed it to the woman. He then allegedly started questioning her about drug dealers in the CBD but the woman said she did not know as she just worked as a sex worker. The officer allegedly forced her on to a bed, and strangled her before raping her and stealing R550 from the woman.
