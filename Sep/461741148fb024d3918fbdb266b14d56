One man's burst pipe turned into another's car wash in Sandton, Johannesburg on Thursday. Desmond Mashele, who was attending a meeting in the area on Thursday, told News24 that he first noticed water spewing from the side of the road, and cars lining up to drive through it, during his lunch break. In one of the videos that went viral on social media, Mashele is heard saying: "Man I love being South African!" A woman in the room retorts, "This is us not wasting water." Mashele eventually took his own car down for a wash and asked a colleague to capture the experience on camera.He also shot video from inside his vehicle."It was a very fun experience. My car is very clean," he laughed. Mashele said there was quite a traffic jam at one stage. "What happened is that you have to pass one side and then go and turn so that you can wash the other side. The taxis were reversing back and forth." He said that it was heartwarming to see people "embrace laughing" even though we've been going through a lot as a country.
