EFF leader Julius Malema's tweet containing quotes next to a picture late Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe has been found not to have violated Twitter's rules, Malema posted on Sunday. He posted a note from the social media company telling him that there had been a complaint about his slideshow of Mugabe quotes, hashtagged #Gushungo, after Mugabe's family totem. The words on one slide, "The only white man you can trust is a dead white man", next to a picture of Mugabe, was flagged by a DA leader Atholl Trollip as "racist" and "incendiary". "The @SAHRC  always, flatters only to deceive spectacularly. Because they are conflicted by trying  to comply with the wishes of the ANC government & not our CONSTITUTION. Malema’s racist invective is not only offensive, unconstitutional and vile, it’s also dangerously incendiary," Trollip's tweet continued.
