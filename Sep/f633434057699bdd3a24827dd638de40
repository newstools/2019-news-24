However, her friends fear for her safety in hospital should the accused be granted bail at his next appearance. Speaking to DRUM, one of the victim’s friends who asked to speak on condition of anonymity revealed that they fear the suspect might finish their friend off in hospital since he allegedly slashed her with a panga. “He cut her stomach open with a panga, It is clear he wanted to kill her. He is heartless and should remain in custody for our friend’s safety,” she said. The friend alleges that the victim was attacked after ending her three-year old relationship with the suspect. “ She said she didn’t want to be with him anymore because he was abusive. We supported her decision. We didn’t know that this guy was capable of something so gruesome.”
