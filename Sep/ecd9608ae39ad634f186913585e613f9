EFF leader Julius Malema took a contingent of legal muscle along to the Hawks' head offices in Pretoria on Tuesday to deliver his warning statement. Malema drove onto the premises of the Directorate for Priority Crimes, followed by advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi and advocate Laurence Hodes and attorney Ian Levitt.Â All three legal minds previously represented the organisation.

WATCH: Malema cries foul on VBS, praises Mashaba but calls DA racist While EFF commander-in-chief Julius Malema welcomes calls for his party to be investigated over allegations that it was involved in the collapse of VBS Mutual Bank, he insists the claims were intended to destroy the party. Malema's legal team and party leaders, Mandisa Mashego, Godrich Gardee and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, were met by a large group of supporters when they arrived at the Hawks' offices. At least eight busses were seen dropping off supporters in their hundreds. The warning statement relates to allegations that Malema discharged a firearm in public in the Eastern Cape. Malema was captured on camera seemingly discharging what appeared to be a semi-automatic rifle at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane, East London, at the party's fifth anniversary celebrations last year. At the time, party spokesperson Ndlozi denied that a real firearm had been used. During a media briefing at the party's headquarters in Johannesburg last week, Malema told journalists he was expecting to be charged.
