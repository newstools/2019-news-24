THE Despatch High School U/15 netball team participated in the Kay Motsepe National Netball tournament in Magaliesburg and ended as the 7th best in South Africa. The team’s coach, Theresa Prince said, “This netball team, with only nine players in the team, is the Eastern Cape Metro champion and now has achieved this exceptional goal on national level.” “The team with great excitement boarded the plane and landed at Lanseria Airport to join the 36 best teams from across the country to participate in the Kay Motsepe National Netball tournament,” she said. In the final round of the tournament, the netball team played against Middelburg High School to determine seventh and eight positions and they won 31-7. In total the netball team during the tournament won eight games and lost three. “I don’t have enough words to describe the pride we as a school carry in our hearts. Our netball has gone from strength to strength. The players work hard and only give their best and therefore we can see the fruit of their labour,” said Prince. She concluded by saying that they are looking forward to more adventures in the 2020 netball season.
