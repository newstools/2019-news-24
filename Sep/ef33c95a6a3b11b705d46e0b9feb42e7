Koos Strydom, the man believed to be the mastermind behind the infamous Mooinooi killings, has allegedly killed himself, IOL reports. He was reportedly found unconscious in his single cell at Kgosi Mampuru 111 Prison in Pretoria on Friday and was rushed to hospital. It was believed he might have overdosed on tablets or ingested poison. Department of Correctional Services officials confirmed his death, adding the circumstances were being investigated. Strydom, 54, his wife Mercia Strydom, 23, Aaron Sithole, 26, his brother Jack Sithole, 19, and Alex Modau, 36, are accused of killing same-sex couple Anisha and Joey van Niekerk who were raped and murdered in December 2017. They were last seen alive when they left their smallholding near Mooinooi, about 40km from Rustenburg, for a funeral in Pretoria on December 10. Their burned-out vehicle was found six days later in the Magaliesburg area. According to court testimony, Strydom gave the order for the couple to be killed after they had signed a bogus contract stating he had bought their property on which he ran a panel beating business, IOL reported. This after he had tired of paying the Van Niekerks rent, Strydom's son testified. Netwerk24 reported Kalafong Hospital had apparently called Mercia late on Friday morning and requested her to come in "because they want to turn off the machines". She was reportedly hysterical, sources told the publication. Paramedics had treated Strydom before he was taken to the hospital, the publication reported. A letter was also apparently found in his cell. - Compiled by Tammy Petersen
