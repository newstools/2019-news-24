Police used a water cannon and stun grenades to try and disperse protesters who had blocked a major road in the Cape Town city centre on Wednesday. The group had earlier asked for President Cyril Ramaphosa to address them on gender-based violence at the Cape Town International Convention Centre, which is currently hosting the World Economic Forum on Africa.
