On
Wednesday the parents of six-year-old Amy-Leigh de Jager, who was kidnapped at
school in Vanderbijlpark, Gauteng on Monday, spent hours at the police station
to assist in apprehending their daughter’s kidnappers. The next
day (today) police confirmed in a statement that a 50-year-old man and two
women, aged 27 and 40 respectively, had been arrested in connection with the
kidnapping at their homes in Vanderbijlpark. “The three
are suspected of being the main role players in the kidnapping,” national
police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, says. Members of
the SAPS Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit as well as
the Crime Intelligence Unit interviewed Amy-Leigh’s family for information that
could aid the investigation. “I can’t
stop crying. I’m so deeply grateful she’s back,” Amy-Leigh’s aunt Louise Horn
wrote on Facebook. “Thank you
to every police member who hasn’t stopped working for a second.” Amy-Leigh,
a Grade R pupil at Kollegepark Primary School in Vanderbijlpark, was snatched
on Monday morning after her mom, Angeline, dropped her off at school. The
kidnappers later demanded a ransom of R2 million, which wasn’t paid. Amy-Leigh was
found on Tuesday morning at 2am by a passerby in a street in Vanderbijlpark
after the kidnappers had dropped her there. The
suspects are in custody and will appear in the magistrate’s court in Vanderbijlpark
on Friday 6 September.
