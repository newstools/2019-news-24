A dad has
been accused of killing his daughter after claiming she’d shot herself in the
face by mistake. Ronald Lee
McMullen Jr. from Oklahoma in the US was charged with first-degree murder after
investigators accused him of molesting and then murdering his 22-year-old
daughter Kailee McMullen in 2017, People
reports. The
45-year-old man, who’s on trial for his daughter’s murder now, firmly maintains
that his daughter fatally shot herself in the head – even after her friends
testified that she’d told them she’d been molested in the months prior to her
death, Daily
Mail reports. Multiple
witnesses have testified that the former cheerleader had been complaining of
her dad’s abuse, according to Fox
News. “She told me her dad hit her and made her nose bleed,” one
witness testified. The trial
is expected to continue for the next two weeks. Sources: People,
