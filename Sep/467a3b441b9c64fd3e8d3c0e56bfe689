Five cases of cholera have been confirmed in Mozambique following the cyclone that ravaged the country, killing at least 468 people Last week, the ministry reported four cases of cholera in Blue Nile. It also said that three deaths from acute diarrhoea had also been reported in Blue Nile. WHO at the time said it was working closely with health authorities in Blue Nile to tackle cholera cases there.
