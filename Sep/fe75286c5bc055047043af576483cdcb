A couple was charged
with theft after going on a shopping spree with money that was accidentally
deposited in their account. Robert Williams (35)
and his wife, Tiffany (36), from Pennsylvania in the US, reportedly received an
accidental deposit of $120 000 (about R1,8 million rand) into their
account, according to investigators. Instead of reporting
the error to the bank, the pair decided to spend it over a period of two weeks,
Fox5
reports. The pair reportedly gave
their friends in need each $15 000 (about R225 000). Robert and Tiffany
appeared in court on Tuesday 3 September on theft charges and were recently
prosecuted, New York Post reports. According to the
police, a clerk accidentally deposited the money into the couple’s joint
account on 31 May. By the time the bank
contacted Tiffany in June about the huge clerical mistake, the couple had
already spent most of it, according to News.com.au. The wife then told the
bank that she would speak to her husband and find a way to “construct a
repayment agreement”. After not hearing from the couple for a while, the bank
contacted the police to help collect the stolen money. During an interview
with the authorities, Robert said that he and his wife knew that the money didn’t
belong to them but they chose to spend it anyway. “That’s kind of
shocking,” Nate Weaver, a neighbour, told local media. “With all the
procedures the banks have set up, checking and double-checking and
triple-checking – there’s no way anybody gets away with that stuff.” The couple have been
released on $25 000 (around R375 000) bail. Sources: Fox5, News.com.au, New
