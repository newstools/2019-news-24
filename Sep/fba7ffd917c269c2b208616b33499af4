With the recent rapes and brutal killings of young women around the country Tembalethu School for Learners with Special Educational Needs took to the streets of Gugulethu. The school protested along NY 3 to voice their concerns when about abuse of young women on Monday 9 September. The learners carried placards denouncing the killing of women and children. “Stop killing us”, “Where are we safe now”, “Children have the right to be safe” and “Women abuse must stop” were just some of the messages.. School principal Ayanda Mtshazo said they wanted to show sympathy with girls that have been killed. He said the school has three girls who are currently attending counselling after they were allegedly raped. Mtshazo said they wanted to end rape and urged the community to stop victimising girls. “As the school we are saying enough is enough and we want government to do something,” he said. He said government must have separate courts that deal with rape and that the perpetrators must be denied bail. When the perpetrators are out on bail they threaten or victimise the victims and some would rape more women, he said. Mtshazo said they were also calling for an end to the xenophobic attacks that are currently taking place in Gauteng. “Africans can’t be killing each other. Xenophobia must stop. We are all Africans,” he said. He said government is not doing enough to stop senseless killings in the country.
