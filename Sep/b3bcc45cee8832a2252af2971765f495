Zimbabwe's former president Robert Mugabe will lie in state at Kutama on Sunday following a burial early next week in his private residence and not at a national monument for liberation heroes, his family said on Thursday. The family of Mugabe, who died in Singapore last week, and Zimbabwe's government have been at odds over whether he would be buried in his homestead in Kutama, northwest of Harare, or at the National Heroes Acre in the capital. Mugabe, whose autocratic rule ended in a military coup in 2017, died last Friday, aged 95. His body was flown back from Singapore on Wednesday.
