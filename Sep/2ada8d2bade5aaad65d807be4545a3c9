An off-duty police officer was stabbed to death in what appears to be a robbery in Kleinvlei, Cape Town on Sunday. Western Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut confirmed that the officer was murdered in the early hours of the morning. "The 28-year-old constable stationed at Delft police station was leaving a shop in the area, accompanied by a friend, when he was stabbed to death during an apparent robbery by two unknown suspects who are yet to be arrested," Traut said. A murder case is under investigation. The incident comes after two law enforcement officers were shot dead while protecting workers at a construction project in Philippi on Wednesday.
