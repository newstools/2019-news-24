MASJID Ibaadur Rahman in Uitenhage will be having an open day on September 24 to allow the public to learn more about the Islamic religion. The mosque is one of 44 participating in the National Mosque Open Day and will be open to the public between 14:00 to 16:00. Imam Farooq Chilunga from Masjid Ibaadur Rahman said he is looking forward to seeing the community at their open day. “Most of the time people just walk by and hear the call to prayer and probably wonder what is going on,” he said. Chilunga said people are welcome to tour the mosque, ask questions about the religion and the Muslim community, learn about some of the religious prayers and watch a presentation about Islam. The chairperson of the South African Muslim Network, Faisal Suliman said last year the open day hosted approximately 800 visitors at the 20 mosques in four provinces that participated. Suliman said this year they have doubled that figure to 44 Mosques in six provinces across the country. “Heritage Day, South Africans engage with and learn about other cultures, celebrate their history and how far we have come as an integrated society,” said Suliman. Visitors are encouraged to dress conservatively. Snacks will be served. For more information visit the SAMNET website www.samnet.co.za.
