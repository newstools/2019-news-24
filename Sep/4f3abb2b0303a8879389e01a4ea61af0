Patients and staff at the Mitchells Plain Day Hospital were evacuated on Friday morning after a fire broke out, the City of Cape Town's fire and rescue services said. "We currently have six firefighting appliances, a rescue vehicle [and] an aerial appliance with a total of 28 staff on scene," said spokesperson Jermaine Carelse . "The quick reaction time of the fire crews resulted in the fire being contained to the theater section of the hospital." The fire was brought under control just before 14:30 and extinguished after 15:00. Photos showed that a section of roof had been destroyed and many rooms were gutted.
