A man has been arrested for allegedly disrespecting a Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officer in Midrand on Saturday. In a video, which the officer recorded, a belligerent driver can be seen giving the officer the middle finger. According to police, the man refused to stop when he was pulled over - first, by one police officer and later, by a second. "The driver swore at a female officer and asked to see her appointment card. He showed her his [driver's] licence and showed her his middle finger," JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said. The driver was arrested for crimen injuria, obstructing a police officer from executing duty and resisting arrest. He was charged and detained at the Midrand police station. "Disrespect of JMPD officers will never be tolerated. Anyone who disrespects the JMPD uniform and the badge will be harshly dealt with and will be arrested," said Minnaar. The driver cannot be identified until he appears in court.
