The police have launched a manhunt for three suspects after a group of armed men robbed a cash-in-transit guard at an Engen garage in Protea Glen, Johannesburg, on Friday. "We have opened a case of cash-in-transit robbery, but we have no leads at the moment," police spokesperson Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng told News24. In CCTV footage that has been widely circulated, one of the armed assailants is seen attacking a guard as he exits the garage with a bag of money. A tussle ensues and the guard is shot in the leg. His firearm is then stolen. When the shooter makes his way out of the convenience store, he is confronted by two other guards. Another shootout ensues, but before long the assailant dashes into a grey Volkswagen Jetta and makes his getaway. No one sustained any fatal injuries. Mashiteng was unable to confirm the amount of money stolen by the three suspects. "We appeal to the community to come forward with any leads or information," said Mashiteng.
