The 12-year-old Grade 6 girl who died after being shot outside the Izibuko Primary School in Katlehong on Wednesday afternoon was the victim of a stray bullet from what was most likely a drive-by shooting. According to police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini, at around 17:45 on Wednesday, another child's parents had come to pick up their child after returning from a school trip. "They were there to pick their child up when a group of men in a Toyota Quantum [minibus] drove by and started firing shots at them," Dlamini said.
