The Free State municipalities of Mafube, Nketoana and Dihlabeng can expect diminished water supply due to the Lesotho Highland Water Project’s planned shutdown  from October to November. According to the Department of Water and Sanitation, this is due to maintenance work. The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority, in conjunction with the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority, is planning the shutdown of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project’s water transfer and delivery tunnel. To ensure the optimal operation of the conveyance system, it is necessary to complete maintenance work. According to the department, this is a normal process that is undertaken every ten years, or as the need arises.
