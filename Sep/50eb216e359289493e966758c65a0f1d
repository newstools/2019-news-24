 A dramatic video in which punches are traded, people pull each other’s hair and expletives fly, had people talking this week – and of course social media didn’t hold back. While some claim the fracas was in Brakpan others suggest the location was Pretoria North in stead. But what’s very obvious from the footage is that the people were fed up with one another. The shrieking voices make it difficult to clearly discern what’s being said, although here and there four-letter words are clearly audible. One man even grabs hold of a plastic pipe to state his “case”. In between all the yelling, the videographer repeatedly shouts from across the street@ “Hugo, call the police, Hugo, call the police!” It didn’t however have the slightest effect on the wild action unfolding before her eyes. “Stop it, stop it, I’m calling the police!” she warns all in vain. “You’re being evicted on Monday,” she adds as the combatants get into their car and drive off. At that point a bare-chested male with an artificial leg appears from the back of the house and strikes the back window of the moving car. “I have a video, Madam, your tenants are here, you’re being evicted on Monday,” the videographer threatens again. Although it’s still not clear what caused the fighting, the video has spread like wildfire, doing its bit to revive South Africans’ sense of humour.
