More than 230 Johannesburg firefighters have been suspended, according to a report by Eyewitness News (EWN). EWN reports that, in July, the firefighters refused to attend to call-outs, citing concerns over the non-assignment of supervisors. Emergency Services spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi reportedly confirmed the suspensions but said they are dealing with the matter internally and would not elaborate on the reason for the suspensions. EWN said it was in possession of suspension letters served on the firefighters from different stations across Johannesburg last week. The firefighters reportedly accuse Emergency Services Management of not adhering to the National Health Act. Some of them are reportedly forced to live in an unsafe building. Firefighters in Johannesburg have been facing a series of challenges.

In the same month, firefighters marched in the inner city to raise awareness about a spate of attacks on Emergency Management Services personnel who tried to help residents. According to EWN, firefighters say if there were to be a major disaster in the city, Emergency Services would find themselves in a crisis. Mulaudzi, however, reportedly said there was no need for alarm. News24's attempts to get hold of Mulaudzi for comment were unsuccessful.
