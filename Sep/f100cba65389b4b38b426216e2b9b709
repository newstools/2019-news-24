An American man has drowned while
attempting an underwater proposal to his girlfriend. Chilling footage shows Steven Weber
Jnr, from Baton Rouge in Louisiana, popping the question to his girlfriend,
Kenesha Antoine, in a swimming pool in Tanzania, Sun
UK reports. The couple had been on holiday in
East Africa and were staying off the coast on Pemba Island. Steven decided to surprise Kenesha
by swimming underwater and holding a handwritten note against a glass window
inside the pool, FOX
News reports. The note, which was placed inside a
sealed plastic bag, read: “I can’t hold my
breath long enough to tell you everything I love about you. But . . .  Everything I love about you I love more every
day. Will you please be my wife? Marry me???” Tragically,
Steven never got to hear his girlfriend accept as he failed to resurface. It’s
believed he ran out of breath and lost consciousness underwater.  The video ends before he drowns.  In a
post on Facebook, Kenesha shared the couple’s final moments together in a
touching tribute, CNN reports. “There
are no words adequate enough to honour the beautiful soul that is Steven Weber
Jnr,” she writes. “You
were kind, compassionate, you regularly made me cry with laughter, and you
showered me with a love like none I’d ever experienced.  “We
never got to embrace and celebrate the beginning of the rest of our lives
together, as the best day of our lives turned into the worst, in the cruellest
twist of fate imaginable.” Steven’s
sister, Mandy Hoffman, described her brother as a selfless and giving person
who had an infectious smile.  "He
had an infectious smile and the most beautiful eyes and he loved everybody
around him and to say that everybody loved him is an understatement," she
said. The
body hasn’t yet been returned to the United States. Sources:
