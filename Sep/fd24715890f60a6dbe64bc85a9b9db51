Chester Williams' wife, Maria, took to the stage with her three children - Matthew, Chloe and Ryan at her husband's memorial on Wednesday - and asked the UWC rugby players to join her in what was one of the day's most touching moments. "I want you to know that Chester loved each and every one of you," Maria told the young players, fighting back tears. "He had such a passion for this University, and he worked day and night. UWC is our family." These were Maria's words to Chester's players as she presented one of the legend's framed jersey's to the team.
