Makasi said the opening of Samora Machel station has also played a role in the decrease. “We will have to pull our socks up together with police so we can see a difference in the next crime statistics,” he said. Khayelitsha CPF chairperson Nomawethu Mosana said they have never been in the top 10 before. She said that murders have gone up in the precinct which is as a result of a lot of guns in the community.
