Looters descended on the busy N1 highway in Johannesburg on Wednesday morning to pick out their share of fresh eggs from a truck that overturned. According to Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) spokesperson Wayne Minnaar, the truck lost control and overturned on an island near the Allandale off-ramp. A video recorded after the accident shows a number of people running towards the wreckage. Some of them make off with cartons of eggs. "The driver was still trapped inside while the truck was being looted, but he managed to get out uninjured," said Minnaar. He said that the looting stopped once law enforcement officials arrived on the scene.
