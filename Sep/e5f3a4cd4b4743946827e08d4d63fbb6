George Municipality is fuming over cyclists whizzing around the Garden Route dam wall construction site after one cyclist's accident caused an expensive work shutdown recently. Municipal spokesperson Chantel Edwards-Klose said the construction area around the dam has been cordoned off, but cycling enthusiasts have ignored all of the barricades and warnings. She said a cyclist was recently injured within the site and was found by other cyclists, also allegedly trespassing. The injured cyclist was lying on a route travelled by numerous 36 ton articulated dump trucks travelling between the borrow pit and the dam wall, and they don't expect a member of the public to pop into view. "An injured person would in all probability not have been noticed in time for a driver to come to a stop resulting in an almost certain fatality," she said. The medical evacuation brought all construction activities at the site to a grinding halt. An access road had to be levelled to get to the cyclist, while health and safety agents had to investigate, and an incident report written up. The time delay resulted in the contractor having to bear the burden of the costs of ceasing all activities as concrete was being poured. The plant had to be shut down and work restarted later when the area was cleared and declared safe. "The situation results in a minority group exposing the entire community to project delays and cost claims by the contractor," she said. "George Municipality urgently appeals to the community of George to adhere to the signage and warnings and to acknowledge and comply with the request not to enter the area at any time."
