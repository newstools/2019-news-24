The teen, who
allegedly turned 19, was in Xochimilco, a neighbourhood in Mexico City which is
famous for its canals, at the time of the incident. It’s reported
that the youngster, whose name has not been released, was aboard a colourful
vessel – locally known as a trajinera
– when he tumbled into the water. His large group of friends and family were travelling together in several boats
and after a period of drinking, revellers started hopping from one trajinera to
another, according to reports. A video filmed by a friend shows the 19-year-old falling into the canal and
disappearing underwater while trying to jump from one boat to another. Attendees searched for the fallen teen in the water for several minutes and
called the emergency services when they were unable to locate him. The search team
reportedly found his body in the canal 12 hours later. Due to its
historical importance, Unesco has ruled the canal system as a World Heritage
Site and it can’t be shut down following the teen’s tragic death. The investigation
into the teen’s death is ongoing. Source: MAGAZINEFEATURES.CO.ZA
