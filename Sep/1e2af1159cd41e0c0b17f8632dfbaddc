Northern
Cape police spokesperson Captain Tessa Jansen confirmed that a 27-year-old
man’s body was found hanging at the West End cemetery in Kimberley. This comes
after the father of two, who’s since been identified as Thabang Tau, sent his
girlfriend a chilling text which read, “When you enter the cemetery you’ll find
me at the bloekom [bluegum] tree.” “The man’s
girlfriend revealed that she received a text from Thabang around 9.30am
instructing her to meet him at West End Cemetery,” said Jansen. “When she
arrived at the cemetery she searched for him briefly before she asked the
cemetery caretakers to point her to where the bloekom trees are.” According to
Jansen this was allegedly when she found their dog sitting under a tree. When
she looked up, she made the horrific discovery of her partner hanging from a branch
on Wednesday morning. “The
girlfriend revealed that on Monday, prior to this tragedy, they’d had a quarrel
which they managed to resolve but [she said she] didn’t realise it would result
in this,” said Jansen.
