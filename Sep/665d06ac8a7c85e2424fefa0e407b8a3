Justice was finally served for a rape victim with a disability following the sentencing of the accused to a long prison term by the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court. On Friday, 30 August, the court sentenced the accused Mmulelo Steven Macwili (33) to life imprisonment after finding him guilty of raping a minor girl with a disability on 5 December 2014. This outcome ended the almost five-years wait for justice. The court found the healthcare worker guilty on two counts of rape. Following his conviction Magistrate Jan Grayvensteyn sentenced the accused of raping the victim, then 12-year-old. The victim, who is mute (unable to speak) is wheelchair-bound. She was admitted at Life Pasteur Hospital in Bloemfontein when the reported crime happened. Phaladi Shuping, provincial spokesperson for the Director of Public Prosecutions, said the court heard that on the day of the incident, Macwili first raped the complainant in her ward. The incident came to light after the victim reported the incidents to a doctor. The doctor asked the victim to write on a piece of paper the name of the person who violated her. Shuping said Magistrate Greyvensteyn pointed out that he was impressed by the complainant’s testimony to tell the court truth what happened on 5 December in 2014. He said the Magistrate rejected the accused’s version, deeming it “only a denial without any substance.” Shuping said the court further ordered that Macwili’s name should be included in the National Register for Sex Offenders and declared unfit to possess a firearm.
