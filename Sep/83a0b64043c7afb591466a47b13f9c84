The Laerskool Kollegepark teacher who was arrested on Wednesday for the kidnapping of 6-year-old Amy'Leigh de Jager in Vanderbijlpark, was allegedly using "narcotics" and owed money to drug lords. This is according to a WhatsApp voice note which a man, who claims to be the teacher's father, sent to a family member. Amy'Leigh's grandfather and parents arrived at theÂ Vanderbijlpark Magistrate's Court on Monday, where the teacher and her two co-accused are appearing. The 27-year-old teacher, whose name is known to News24, was arrested along with two alleged accomplices by members of the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit.
