A father of
three allegedly blew up his own home in an apparent suicide on the day of his
daughter’s wedding. John Evans (59),
from Pennsylvania in the US, is believed to be responsible for the gas
explosion that ripped through his home, Sun
UK reports. Police were
immediately called to the scene after the terrifying blast shook several other
homes in the street. Emergency crew later found John’s body in the wreckage and
ruled his death a suicide. According to
social media, one of John’s three daughters, Lauren, was getting married on the
day and police said most of the family were at the wedding when the explosion
happened, Metro
UK reports. “This gentleman apparently had some personal
issues and we’ve had information from neighbours that would indicate that
there’s a great potential here that he would have blown the house up,” police
chief Robert Payne told local media. He added that police had previously been
called to John’s home and knew of his mental health problems, PEOPLE reports. According to neighbours, the house collapsed
within two minutes of the explosion. "I was devastated. I’ve been here my whole life.
I’ve known them my whole life,” neighbour Donna Antolovich told local media. "Their daughter was getting married today and
they were supposed to be at a wedding." One of John’s daughters, Ashlee, posted on Facebook
hours after the incident asking people to respect the family’s privacy. Sources: Sun
