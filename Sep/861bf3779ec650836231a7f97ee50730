Police are searching for two suspects involved in an armed robbery at a convenience store in Johannesburg on Thursday evening. CCTV footage of the incident was shared on social media, showing one of the suspects pointing a firearm at the store owner. "The suspects pretended to be customers until one of the suspects took out his weapon," said police spokesperson Captain Hector Netshivhodza. Netshivhodza told News24 that the suspects took an undisclosed amount of cash, a box of cigarettes and the store owner's cellphone before fleeing. "It is important to note that this was not an attack on foreign nationals, it was just a normal crime," he said. A case of armed robbery was opened at the Lenasia police station with no arrests made thus far.
