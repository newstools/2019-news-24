Police are searching for 16 armed suspects involved in a cash-in-transit heist in Pretoria on Tuesday. According to police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Brenda Muridili, the driver of the van was transporting cash to Mayville when he was stopped by the armed gang. "Plus-minus 16 suspects with rifles approached the van. They shot several shots in the air," Muridili said. She said the gang threatened to bomb the van and forced the occupants to exit it before taking bags of money. Footage recorded by bystanders shows one of four getaway vehicles going up in flames, presumably after it hit a pavement. The suspects made off in the remaining three cars. Muridili adding that an investigation into the Nissan bakkie that caught alight revealed it had been stolen in August. An undisclosed amount of money was taken from the van. This comes just a week after South Africaâ€™s 2018/2019 crime statistics report was released, showing a significant (-23.1%) drop in cash-in-transit attacks compared to 2017/2018. Gauteng was the province with the most cash-in-transit heists, with 62 reported incidents between 2018 and 2019.
