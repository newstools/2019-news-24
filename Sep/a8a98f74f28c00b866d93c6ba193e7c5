South African protesters demand crackdown on femicide With placards stating "Enough is enough", hundreds of protesters marched in Johannesburg on Friday to protest at gender-based violence in one of the world's most crime-ridden countries. Dlamini was initially whisked away as protesters got agitated by her presence, but apparently returned later when they calmed down, according to News24's reporter on the scene. In a video posted on Twitter, Dlamini seems unperturbed by the heckling. A man asks her: "Do you feel welcome by the protesters here?" She responds by waving the camera away.

In addition, 36 597 sexual offences against women were reported in the same period. Gender-based violence has been in the spotlight over the past few weeks, following the brutal murders of several women, which sparked the #AmINext movement that also saw women outing alleged sexual offenders.
