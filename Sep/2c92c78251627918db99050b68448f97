There has been a spate of violence perpetrated against women in recent weeks, with government officials claiming more than 20 women were killed in August. The violent murders of boxing champion Leighandre "Baby Lee" Jegels, University of Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana, teenager Janika Mallo and youth leader Jesse Hess have sparked anger, debate over the death penalty and seen scores of women speaking out about their own instances of violence perpetrated by men.
