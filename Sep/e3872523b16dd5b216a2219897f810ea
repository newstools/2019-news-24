Officials at a sanctuary in Thailand said on Friday they are racing to keep dozens of tigers alive after more than 80 died from disease following their confiscation from a controversial temple. The Wat Pha Luang Ta Bua temple - better known as the "Tiger Temple" - had for years attracted tourists with the promise of being able to pose for photos next to the big cats.

Thailand gets some 38 million tourists a year, with many of them attracted by a large wildlife tourism industry. Activists say abuse is rife in the industry. Raids in 2016 on the Tiger Temple uncovered dozens of dead tiger cubs inside a freezer. Legal cases against the temple are ongoing.
