Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato called on men to take up the fight against gender-based violence and child abuse at the Civic Centre on Thursday. Plato and Cape Town's mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith led a candle-lighting ceremony in memory of victims. "There are many myths around domestic violence. People say it's caused by alcohol or drugs or it's only limited to specific demographic areas, but that's not true. Domestic violence happens in all of our neighbourhoods and all of our economic areas," Smith said. Plato led the gathering in a pledge, in which Cape Town men said they would take a stand against the abuse of women and children.
