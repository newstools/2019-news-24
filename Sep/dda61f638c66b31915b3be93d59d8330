This failure has a direct and detrimental effect on the lives and safety of the citizens of Nelson Mandela Bay, notably those living in crime riddled areas; .

The Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, said the letter exposes a number of misconceptions, a shallow grasp of the role the chamber is supposed to play and the manner in which it is supposed to engage the leadership and management of the municipality. Bobani added, “In their letter, they disgenuously create a wrong perception that the municipality is dysfunctional. As this coalition government, we remain committed in working with the Business Chamber to take this city forward. Our doors are always open, they know that.” Bobani stated that the business chamber has decided to ignore their formal engagement processes and platforms and have deliberately taken a direction of a media campaign to discredit the administration. “They dishonestly create a perception that we do not want to meet them, knowing exactly that I mandated the Deputy Executive Mayor and the Acting City Manager to meet them and discuss the issues they have raised,” Bobani said. The metro has since indicated that they are still prepared to meet and discuss the issues raised.
