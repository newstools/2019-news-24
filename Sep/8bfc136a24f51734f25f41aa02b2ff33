As South Africa grapples with its gender-based violence crisis, design and art teacher Wayne Tewson took the liberty of writing a pledge for the boys of Bracken High School in Alberton, Ekurhuleni. "Gender-based violence in this society is a crime and I feel strongly about addressing it. Something that was important to me was to show young men how to respond to an issue such as this - to speak to love and spread a positive attitude towards women," Tewson told News24. "Random boys, naughty kids and kids with full colour blazers and what not - they came forward and said they'd like to take the pledge." Besides the involvement of the boys seen in the video, Bracken High School students were also involved in filming and editing the actual video. "The boys who were a part of the video found themselves in the situation where they wanted to be good men and respect the lives of others and do not want to fall under the hashtag of men are trash. So this pledge became the first step for those boys to identify the kind of men that they would like to be," he added. Tewson hopes that other schools in South Africa will decide to write their own pledges. "We are trying to spread the message and see how many boys we can get to stand up and be good men."
