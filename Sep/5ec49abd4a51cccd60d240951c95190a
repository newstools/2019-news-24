A "miscommunication" led to a Joburg man getting impaled on a gate spike in Craighall, Johannesburg, on Wednesday afternoon. According to Emer-G-Med paramedic Moelich Odendal, who responded to the scene, the man, a gardener, was working on a ladder when the incident occurred. The man's employer, unaware that he was working near the gate, opened the electric gate from inside the house. "The gate then bumped the ladder causing the man to fall on to the spike," Odendal told News24. "It was a freak accident. The man suffered a massive tissue injury, but fortunately no bones were broken. "His employer accompanied him to hospital where he received further treatment."
