Natasha Conabeer was reported missing on August 18. According to a missing person report, she left her flat for Inanda to visit family. On Sunday, it was reported that she had been found alive after the unconscious student was dropped outside her home on Sunday morning. She was taken to hospital where her mother, Rosemary Conabeer, had told News24 that "doctors are doing everything they can for her". But on Monday, the news broke that she had died in hospital. Family friend Zamambo Mkhize confirmed the news to News24: "She passed away earlier this morning in hospital." The cause of death has not yet been established. Police have opened an inquest docket at Durban North police station, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said. The news of the 23-year-old's death comes a week after protest action in parts of the country aimed at shining the spotlight on violence against women and children. It also comes days after University of Cape Town (UCT) and University of the Western Cape (UWC) students, Uyinene Mrwetyana and Jesse Hess, were laid to rest. Mourners took to social media to mourn Natasha's death. *This story has been amended to reflect that Conabeer had applied to UKZN in 2014, but never formally registered, according to the university. Police comment has also been added.
