Aid group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on Monday accused the World Health Organisation of rationing the Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of Congo where more than 2 100 people have died of the deadly virus. "One of the main problems currently is the fact that in practice the vaccine is rationed by the WHO and that too few people at risk are protected today," MSF said. WHO sounds Ebola alarm as risks intensify The World Health Organization has declared Congo's Ebola outbreak an international health emergency, sounding a rarely used global alarm after the virus threatened to spread to a major city and into neighboring countries.
