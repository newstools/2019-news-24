Cairo
â€“ Egypt has arrested nearly 2 000 people in what may be its biggest crackdown
since the aftermath of the 2013 ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi,
Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Friday. The authorities have also blocked
or interrupted various internet services and websites, in a bid to stamp out
any repetition of the open defiance of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi shown by
protesters last weekend, the watchdog said. "Lawyers for detainees have
posted on their social media pages several accounts of security forces
arbitrarily arresting many people merely for being in the 'wrong place at the
wrong time' or possessing critical content on their phones," HRW said in a
statement. "The government also has
deployed uniformed and plainclothes security officers in Cairo, Alexandria and
other cities in and around main streets and squares, randomly stopping
passersby, searching and questioning people, and forcing them to show the
contents of their mobile phones and social media accounts." Anti-Sisi protests break out in Egypt Rare small protests break out in Cairo and other Egyptian cities, like in those images from the city of Al Mahallah Al Kubra, calling for the removal of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. 'Gross violations of international law' Last weekend's rare protests
against what is widely seen as one of the most authoritarian governments in the
Middle East, were triggered by viral videos from exiled businessman Mohamed
Aly. He has called for a
"million-man march" and a "people's revolution" to unseat
Sisi, whom he accuses of building lavish palaces while taxpayers grapple with
the impact of austerity under an IMF loan programme totalling $12bn. HRW called on Egypt's Western
allies to suspend military assistance until the government ceases its
"gross violations of international law". "World leaders should
recognise that providing security and military assistance to abusive forces
won't bring stability to Egypt, and that what's needed instead is a government
that respects the rights and freedoms of the Egyptian people," said its
Middle East and North Africa director, Sarah Leah Whitson.
