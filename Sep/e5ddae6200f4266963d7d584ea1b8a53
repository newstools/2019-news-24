A womanâ€™s
pregnancy was mistakenly terminated after medical staff performed the procedure
on the wrong woman. The
Vietnamese woman was six-weeks pregnant and visited a clinic in Seoul,
South Korea for a prenatal
checkup. She was allegedly injected with anaesthesia instead of a
nutritional shot after her identity got mixed up with another patient, CNN
reported. While she was under anaesthesia, a doctor performed an
abortion on the woman after staff failed to verify her identity. It was only
after she experienced intense bleeding and returned to the clinic the next day
that she was informed her pregnancy had been terminated, ABCNews
reported. A doctor and a nurse have been arrested on suspicion of professional
negligence resulting in injury, and an ongoing investigation has been launched
regarding the unfortunate incident, according to NYPost. Sources: CNN,
