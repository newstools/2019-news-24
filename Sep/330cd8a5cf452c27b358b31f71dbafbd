South Africa remains on tenterhooks as violence continues to grip the country. However, the political wheel continues to spin and the big story this week is the death of the former president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe. Zimbabwe's founding father died in Singapore last week, aged 95. His legacy is, without question, complex. This week on POLOTIKI, News24 senior politics reporter Tshidi Madia is joined by News24 associate editor of in-depth news Pieter du Toit, and News24 politics reporter Lizeka Tandwa to discuss Mugabe's legacy. Will Mugabe be remembered as a Pan-Africanist revolutionary or a demagogue who was responsible for collapsing Zimbabwe's economy? Another hot topic this week is the debacle where Eyewitness News (EWN) journalist Barry Bateman called EFF leader Julius Malema a "p**s", shortly after an interview on Tuesday. The video was shared widely on social media and Bateman's name - and the word he used - were trending on Twitter on Tuesday. EWN apologised to Malema for Bateman's language. The EFF rejected the apology, calling it "lukewarm". Bateman was removed from air immediately and the broadcaster confirmed an internal probe would be held. POLOTIKI is a weekly politics News24 podcast.
