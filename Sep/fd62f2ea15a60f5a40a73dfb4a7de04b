Brazilian
teen Débora Oliveira was taking part in a go-cart race in Boa Viagem, in
Recife, when the accident happened. Local media
reports Débora (19) lost control of the vehicle and “crashed at least three
times”. Though she was wearing a crash helmet, her hair came loose and got
stuck in one of the wheels. Her scalp was ripped nearly clean off her skull. “I felt a
tug. I took the helmet off, untied my seatbelt and got up. I was bleeding. I
was in shock and started screaming,” she told local media. She was
rushed to Restauracion Hospital, where she’s since spent a total of more than
15 hours in reconstructive surgery, which included hair and skin grafts. Surgeons
were able to replace 80% of the ripped-off scalp and hair. She now faces a long
recovery that could take up to two years. The Walmart
centre where the race was held, issued a statement: “We regret this and are in
contact with the family to provide the victim with the necessary assistance.” Before the
accident, Debora had long hair that hung past her hips.  So far, it
doesn’t seem as if the incident will be investigated. Source: Magazine Features
