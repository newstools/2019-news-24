An elderly woman has been caught on video while driving down the wrong side of a Cape Town highway. A Cape Town businessman, who didn't want to be named, saw the incident while driving on the M3 to Tokai last Thursday. "I looked at this woman and thought, 'what's going on here?'," he told News24. He immediately got his cellphone out and recorded the woman casually driving in the emergency lane against oncoming traffic. "She was so oblivious, cars were hooting at her and she just kept driving." He said the woman looked like she was in her 80s. "I followed her for at least 10km before I lost her," he said City of Cape Town traffic services spokespersonÂ Maxine Bezuidenhout told News24 that the incident had not been reported. "We didn't get that call. We only got the video after the incident," she said. GET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now. Get it for your iPhone here.
