"But it doesn't mean that he doesn't need to pay for his crime," she said. Jasriel said she was angry when she heard the news that he was set to be released on parole on September 23, without any consultation with her or other victims. In a sit-down interview with News24 she recalled the moment her attorney told her the news. "I thought that she was going to tell me he has passed away, but she didn't. She said to me he's going home.
