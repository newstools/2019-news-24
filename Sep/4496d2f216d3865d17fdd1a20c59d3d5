NATIONAL Police Minister Bheki Cele released the crime statistics on September 12. In Greytown and surrounding areas, burglary at residential areas and illegal possession of firearms are on the increase, followed by stock theft. In the crime statistics, the Msinga area is leading with a high rate of possession of unlicenced firearms. Greytown Community Policing Forum chairperson Agrippa Mhlongo said other serious crimes showed a decrease, saying: “The statistics are twofold. It shows a decease and increase in serious crimes compared to the numbers that were released last year. However, we can see that the police are working and we are grateful about it. There are areas that need more attention.” Crime statistics for 2018 — 2019 Greytown Drug-related crime 66 – 99 Murder 22 – 18 Robbery with aggravated circumstances 122 – 64 Stock theft 48 – 50 Rape 28 – 24 Burglary at residential areas 208 – 144 Illegal possession of firearms and ammunition 15 – 32 Robbery at residential premises 10 – 11 Kranskop Drug-related crime 62 – 58 Murder 21 – 28 Robbery with aggravated circumstances 45 – 38 Stock theft 43 – 30 Rape 25 – 31 Burglary at residential premises 77 – 57 Illegal possession of firearms and ammunition 69 – 36 Robbery at residential premises 14 – 12 New Hanover Drug-related crime 124 – 51 Murder 6 – 5 Robbery with aggravated circumstances 17 – 17 Stock theft 3 – 5 Rape 21 – 26 Burglary at residential premises 74 – 79 Illegal possession of firearms and ammunition 8 – 2 Robbery at residential premises 1 – 3 Dalton Drug related crime 124 – 64 Murder 10 – 6 Robbery with aggravated circumstances 21 – 5 Stock theft 11 – 6 Rape 11 – 4 Burglary at residential premises 21 – 22 Illegal possession of firearms and ammunition 27 – 13 Robbery at residential premises 1 – 2 Matimatolo Drug-related crime 37 – 30 Murder 29 – 28 Robbery with aggravated circumstances 14 – 9 Stock theft 21 – 23 Rape 19 – 15 Burglary at residential premises 34 – 34 Illegal possession of firearms and ammunition 24 – 16 Robbery at residential premises 2 – 2 Wartburg Drug related crime 227 – 132 Murder 12 – 14 Robbery with aggravating circumstances 16 – 14 Stock theft 13 – 9 Rape 32 – 23 Burglary at residential premises 43 – 62 Illegal possession of firearms and ammunition 9 – 17 Robbery at residential premises 6 – 4 Msinga Drug-related crime 115 – 59 Murder 76 – 62 Robbery with aggravating circumstances 37 – 45 Stock theft 65 - 67 Rape 65 – 39 Burglary at residential premises 72 – 71 Illegal possession of firearms and ammunition 109 – 145 Robbery at residential premises 8 – 6 Muden Drug-related crime 4 – 0 Murder 6 – 11 Robbery with aggravating circumstances 4 – 12 Stock theft 7 – 21 Rape 7 – 10 Burglary at residential premises 13 – 19 Illegal possession of firearms and ammunition 6 – 13 Robbery at residential premises 1 – 3 Ngome Drug-related crime 27 – 28 Murder 1 – 1 Robbery with aggravating circumstances 5 – 7 Stock theft 52 – 17 Rape 14 – 10 Burglary at residential premises 16 – 7 Illegal possession of firearms and ammunition 10 – 12 Robbery at residential premises 1 – 0 Dundee Drug-related 127 – 146 Murder 17 – 21 Robbery with aggravating circumstances 82 – 95 Stock theft 94 – 100 Rape 51 – 41 Burglary at residential premises 346 – 279 Illegal possession of firearms and ammunition 27 – 17 Robbery at residential premises 12 – 10.
