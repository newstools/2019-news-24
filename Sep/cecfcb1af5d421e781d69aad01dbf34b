A massive
search is under way for kidnapped six-year-old Amy-Lee de Jager, who was
snatched from her school in Vanderbijlpark, Gauteng, early this morning. The Grade R
pupil at Kollegepark Primary was allegedly kidnapped by four men in a white
Toyota Fortuner when her mother dropped her off at school at 8 am. Captain Kay
Makhubela, provincial police spokesman in Gauteng, confirmed the incident but
said the details of what happened were still sketchy. “The public
shouldn’t trust information shared on social media – rather rely on information
released by the police.” News of the
shock snatching of the little girl has spread like wildfire on social media.
There have been reports that the kidnappers contacted the girl’s father to
demand R2 million ransom. Though
police aren’t confirming the ransom report, Ferdi Steyn, a friend of the De
Jagers, has confirmed it to YOU. Police have
stopped a white Toyota Fortuner in Meyerton, north of Vereeniging, but Captain
Makhubela says it wasn’t the kidnappers’ vehicle. Steyn also
reiterated that the public shouldn’t believe all the information disseminated
on social media. “It’s
rumoured that she’s been found but that’s not true. People shouldn’t trust that
information [on social media] because they’ll take their eyes off the road and
as a result we’ll never find her.” YOU has
been unable to contact Amy-Lee’s father, Wynand, who’s a teacher at Carel de
Wet Technical High School in Vanderbiljpark, and he hasn’t responded to
messages. “He’s
keeping his line open for any possible information the kidnappers or the police
can provide,” one of his colleagues said. “Wynand
isn’t at school. The whole town is looking for the [kidnappers’] car.”
