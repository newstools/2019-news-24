A five-year-old
boy allegedly shot and killed his four-year-old brother on Sunday, after
finding a gun in their home while their mom was asleep. Truth Albright
(4), from Fort Worth in the US, was rushed to hospital after his brother (who
remains unnamed) accidentally shot him. The little boy died less than an hour
later, Sun
UK reports. Local Police
said they would not be charging the boy’s parents. "It has been determined that there will be no
charges filed at this time. It’s a very unfortunate situation that occurred,” a
police spokesperson said. Neighbour Larry
Davison said he’d never spoken to the family but would often see two boys
playing outside, Mirror
UK reports. Truth is one of
three children to have been fatally shot on Sunday in that particular county
which has a population of 2 million people. Sources: Sun
