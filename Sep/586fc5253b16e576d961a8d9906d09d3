Independent candidate Kais Saied and imprisoned media mogul Nabil Karoui have advanced to a run-off after obtaining the most votes in Tunisia's September 15 presidential election. The official announcement by the country's electoral commission on Tuesday confirmed constitutional law professor Saied won 18.4% of the vote while Karoui, owner of popular television station Nessma TV, garnered 15.6%. Ennadha's Abdelfattah Mourou came in third with 12.9%.   Saied, a fiercely independent academic, advocates radical decentralisation of power, with local democracy and the ability to remove elected officials from office during their mandates. Karoui, who built his appeal on high-profile charity campaigns, is under investigation for alleged money laundering and has been in pre-trial detention since August 23. He denies all wrongdoing and his supporters attribute his arrest to political manipulation.  The run-off vote will take place before October 23, the day when the interim leader Mohamed Ennaceur's mandate expires. Tunisia will hold legislative elections on October 6.
