Tension, tears and despair filled the room when Durban mother Xoli Mpungose described, in painful detail, discovering her four children who were hanged, allegedly by her partner Sibusiso Mpungose, on Tuesday. Mpungose's children - ages four, six, 10 and 16 - were murdered, one by one, after Sibusiso received final divorce papers. The emotional mother told the media on Wednesday that she found her children hanging at their home in Wyebank.

"In one child's room, he hung them on a burglar bar on the window, with the belt from their night gown. In my room as well, he hung the other one," she said. She said her husband sent their 10-year-old back and forth to the tuckshop to buy snacks, presumably so he would have time to murder each of the children. The father, who appeared in the Pinetown Magistrate's court on Friday morning, will not be applying for bail and will rain in custody until his next appearance on October 9.
