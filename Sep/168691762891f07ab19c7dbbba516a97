A family in Westville, Durban, has a habit of attracting some unwelcome slithery visitors based on their track record. Months after finding a black mamba on their property, they were surprised by the discovery of a second one. Snake catcher Nick Evans, who managed to safely remove the reptile, said the first one was not as lucky. "That was an interesting house because two or three months ago there was a black mamba in the garden. The dog went for it and was bitten in the process - it bit the snake and then the snake bit it back," Evans told News24. The snake bite proved almost fatal for the canine who needed eight vials of antivenom to survive the ordeal. "He [the dog] made a miraculous recovery because very few dogs survive mamba bites," Evans said. The snake did not survive the tussle as it was killed by a neighbourhood security guard. Just as the family thought they had put their snake woes behind them, they found another mamba near their home in early September. This mamba appeared in their neighbour's tree that had its branches hanging over their fence. "It was between the properties â€¦ and a bit of a nightmare situation because everyone was worried about the dog," Evans said. It took him about 10 minutes to capture the snake. "Mambas in trees are always tricky, thankfully I didn't have to climb up the tree." He used a snake tong to pull the 2.1m snake out of the tree. It was later released. Evans urged people to contact him or their local snake catcher if they found slithery visitors on their properties. "When people kill a snake like a mamba they put themselves at risk of being bitten," he said.
