The estranged police officer boyfriend of female boxing champion Leighandre "Baby Lee" Jegels, who shot and killed her on Friday, died in hospital, according to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid). The man was arrested on Friday after a head-on collision near Peddie, in the Eastern Cape. He also shot and wounded Jegels' mother, Rita, who is receiving treatment in hospital.
