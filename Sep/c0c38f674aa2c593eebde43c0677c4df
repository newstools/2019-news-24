A video is doing the rounds on social media of a crowd of people attacking each other in Newlands East, Durban, on Sunday. The video appears to have been recorded by a community member. In it, community members can be heard screaming as someone takes out a gun and starts firing shots. "It is alleged that it was an altercation between two rivals," said police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gala. According to Gala, two people were injured. "Both victims were rushed to the nearest hospital," said Gwala. Police are investigating a case of attempted murder and no arrests have been made.
