UPDATE: At least seven people have died and two others injured in a multi-vehicle accident on the N1 in Tshwane on Friday, according to officials. Two trucks and eight light motor vehicles were involved, said Tshwane Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Charles Mabaso. More bodies were discovered as officials worked through the wreckage on Friday. Five more people have since been reported dead since original publication, taking the known total up to seven. One truck was completely burnt out while another was damaged but managed to be extinguished. "One light motor vehicle [was] trapped underneath the truck and completely burned down with two deceased patients burnt beyond recognition," he said. After the Toyota Avanza was recovered, it then emerged that it contained the bodies of four adults, two children and a toddler. A woman with slight injuries and a man with moderate injuries were taken to hospital. Mabaso said the accident may have been caused by poor visibility because of grass fires in the area. The N1 between Petroport and Wallmansthal was closed in both directions for a few hours. The N1 was re-opened in both directions after a few hours. - This article has been updated to reflect more fatalities reported and roads being re-opened.
