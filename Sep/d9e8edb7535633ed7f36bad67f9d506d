Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi confirmed the incident, saying the Lethabong High Grade 12 pupil drowned on Saturday, September 21 while on a trip with around 48 learners from the Soshanguve school. The pupils, accompanied by three teachers, were on a "Matric dance trip".

A Psycho-Social Unit team has been dispatched to offer counselling to staff and learners. "It is so sad to issue death certificates [rather] than parents attending graduation ceremonies for their children. We would like to convey our deepest condolences to the family and the entire school population during this time of grief," Lesufi said. Gauteng department of education spokesperson Steve Mabona said on Monday the incident actually happened at a lodge in Rustenburg, and not Sun City, as was previously reported. "The plan was for the learners to visit Sun City on Sunday hence the confusion. We apologize for the inconvenience caused," he said. *This story has been updated to include additional comments from Mabona.
