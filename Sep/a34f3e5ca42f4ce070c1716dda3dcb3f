Chester Williams will be laid to rest in a special provincial official funeral at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town on Saturday. Public Works Minister Patricia de Lille announced the news at a memorial for the Springbok legend at the University of the Western Cape on Wednesday. The directive had also been announced by the Presidency. Williams died suddenly from a heart attack last Friday. He was 49. De Lille said she was a close friend of the Williams family. "We were great friends. He used to love to make potjiekos and a braai at the same time. He would sit at the braai and play PJ Powers songs, until I asked him to play something else," De Lille was quoted as saying.     In a statement on Wednesday, the presidency announced that "President Cyril Ramaphosa has honoured the late rugby hero, Chester Mornay Williams, with a declaration of a Special Provincial Official Funeral (Category 2)".
