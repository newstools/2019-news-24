An investigation has been ordered into how a Cape Town post office worker, accused of killing UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana, was employed at the public facility despite an alleged criminal record, said Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams on Tuesday. When the 42-year-old man appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Monday, it emerged the first-year film and media studies student had been killed in the Clareinch post office in Claremont the same day she disappeared - August 24. Flowers and cards were placed outside the post office on Tuesday, after its doors were closed to protesters. "As mothers, as grandmothers, as aunties we need to shut down our city now, we need to get to Parliament, we need to tell our president this is where it stops, this is the last," Claremont resident Eloise Hoffman told News24.
