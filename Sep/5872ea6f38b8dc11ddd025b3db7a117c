Children from Kensington, Factreton and Maitland will be exposed to various safety programmes presented by Paul’s Shuttles (a scholar transport) at Kensington High Primary School at the end of September. The programmes will focus on first aid training for children and the dangers of drugs, fire safety tips, cyberbullying and other types of bullying will also be discussed. The three-day programme will be starting from Thursday 26 August until Saturday 28 September. On the last day, the programme will be split into two sessions – one for adults, tackling issues around sex education in primary school, online pornography, abductions, kidnapping, and human trafficking. Organiser Paul Wayner says dividing the programmes is necessary to make sure that the information is communicated in a language suited for the audience and open conversations will be encouraged. “So much is happening in our communities, we cannot just sit and wait for the government to take action while our children get hurt left and right,” says Wayner. Children will also be given tips on how to observe and be aware of their surroundings, abductions, kidnapping and human trafficking. Wayner says children should be equipped with knowledge. They are the future of this nation. He hopes hundreds of children will participate, and appeals to the public for support. Prizes for showing excellence during the evaluation process will be awarded. Programmes will run daily from 08:00 until 15:00. V
