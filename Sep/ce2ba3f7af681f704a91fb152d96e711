"I can't even let someone hold my kids on their lap," says KwaNobuhle rape survivor Sisanda Solomon. Solomon, who spoke about her experience at an event in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage, at the weekend, said she had been raped repeatedly by the same man when she was four years old, GroundUp reports. "Rape takes something away from you. A small something dies inside of you. "A man saw himself as God and took a decision to rape me." Solomon said she had never spoken about her ordeal to a big audience before. "I speak about it because I want you to know there's a light at the end of the tunnel. She described how her rape had left her with deep distrust. "I have three kids, but I don't want anyone around them. If I am not at home, I call home 20 times. "I can't even let someone put my kids on their laps." More than 300 women carried placards through the streets to the fan park, which they turned into a place of worship.
